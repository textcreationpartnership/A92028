            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:121621:3"/>IN the fleſh,</hi> and <hi>AFTER the fleſh,</hi> or <hi>ACCORDING to the fleſh,</hi> that is, <hi>Judaicall adminiſtrations,</hi> or <hi>humane wiſdome,</hi> which is not according to the Word.

Ramſey</hi> ſo little to it, whereby to enervate any thing of that Treatiſe (it ſtill ſtanding as an impregnable Bullwark) that as to him, there is little left for me to ſay, unleſſe it be to tell <hi>W. Ramſey ſo much;</hi> and to reprove him for his <hi>ill handling the Queſtion;</hi> that deceived ſouls may be reduced.</p>
               <p>Poor <hi>Will.</hi> it ſeems by his Pamphlet, he was diſtracted when he penn'd it. For he confeſſeth in his Epiſtle to <hi>All Well-willers</hi> &amp;c. that he was more <hi>perplexed, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at that inſtant of time his Treatiſe was penn'd, then all his life.</hi> So he. O ſtrange diſtemper! and as ſtrange a phantaſie, that counts the time of his penning of eleven
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:121621:5"/>ſheets, but at the rate of an inſtant. He confeſſeth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>(ibid.)</hi> that his <hi>Genius was weak;</hi> and that <hi>he went, or ran from houſe to houſe, and made it where ever he came.</hi> By which words, I profeſſe I do really ſuſpect, <hi>Will. Ramſey</hi> went about to his Brethren <hi>Aſtrologie</hi>-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers, to beg, or borrow ſome <hi>Latine, Greek,</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew;</hi> but loſt ſome of it as he went home. See anon whether I ſpeak not really true. Out of all let the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reader make the <hi>Criſis</hi> of the mans Cranie. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late his <hi>Epiſtle to the Reader,</hi> with his Book, and you ſhall ſee ſutable fits and feits. Where (poor man) he ſinnes grievouſly, ſometimes in his <hi>raving,</hi> and ſometimes in his <hi>mopiſh</hi> melancholick fits.</p>
               <p>In his <hi>raving,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ira furor Inevis eſt. <hi>Hor.</hi>
                  </note> he miſerably fomes at the mouth, with the froth and ſpittle of <hi>Malicious, Fool, Ignorant, Knave, Babling Prieſts, Wretch,</hi> &amp;c. ſome of which he drivels and ſlavers on M. <hi>Raunce</hi> (for writing againſt Judiciall Aſtrologie) the reſt on the <hi>Doctour,</hi> and all Miniſters without diſtinction. He is ſo bold a <hi>youth</hi> in his Title page as to ſtile himſelf <hi>Gent.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon he is but a Boy.</note> which I ſhould have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued <hi>Gentile-man,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>Gentle-man,</hi> but that his language is the language of a <hi>Peaſant</hi> or <hi>Boore;</hi> unleſſe the Aſtrologer excuſe himſelf, that he was then under the powerful influences of the Conſtellations, <hi>Canis major mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, Taurus, Aries, Lupus, Leo, Scorpius, Serpens, Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> &amp;c. Never any in their ſober witts, have accounted D. <hi>Homes ignorant,</hi> or <hi>fool.</hi> And of <hi>malice</hi> againſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologers,</hi> the Doctour muſt needs be free, in that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that the <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> never did him (that he knows) any perſonall wrong afore the penning of his <hi>Demonologie,</hi> whereby to kindle any malice againſt them in his breaſt, and to vent it in that Book. His Treatiſe of <hi>Demonologie</hi> fairly teſtifies for him, wherein he doth ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly handle the queſtion of the unlawfulneſſe of <hi>Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Aſtrologie;</hi> touching upon no mans perſon. And there alſo profeſſeth his love to the true <hi>Mathematicks,</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:121621:5"/>even as with great delight he ſtudied them in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie. And further, I can aſſure the Reader that he calls God to witneſſe, that meer preſſures of conſcience, to diſcharge his faithfullneſſe to Chriſt (as he is a <hi>Teacher</hi> to one of his Churches) in declaring againſt ſinne and errour, for the preſervation, or reduction of poor ſouls, made him write. But as was the manner of the times in the reign of <hi>Arminianiſme</hi> in England, to queſtion any mans learning, though the ableſt Scholar, if he ſpake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their <hi>Tenets;</hi> ſo now are the manners of <hi>Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> to call their betters every way by the names of <hi>fools, ignorant,</hi> &amp;c. if they do not ſing to their tune but contrary. You ſhall hear by and by <hi>Will. Ramſey</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe <hi>Fathers, School-men, Councills,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See his book. c. 2. p. 38.</note> &amp;c. that ſpeak the leaſt word againſt <hi>Aſtrologie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Will. Ramſey</hi> is in his <hi>mopiſh</hi> fits, I cannot, I ingenuouſly confeſſe, either gather that he ſayes any thing at all to the <hi>Head</hi> he propounds; or what it is he would have ſaid: For inſtance, let the Reader conſider well that head, chap. 1. ſect. 6. p. 33. <hi>Aſtrologie profitable for health.</hi> Nor can I reconcile <hi>Will. Ramſey</hi> with <hi>Will. Ramſey,</hi> there is ſuch contradiction in his words. For page 11. line 25. <hi>me thinks</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Doctour Homes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a wiſe man,</hi> (the phraſe ſignifies an <hi>habituall</hi> wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as tis ſpoken without <hi>limitation</hi> and ſo left univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall) yet in the very next page, but twenty three lines af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he calls Doctour <hi>Homes</hi> a <hi>fool.</hi> If he ſay the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour was a fool in condemning <hi>Aſtrologie;</hi> then <hi>W. R.</hi> further like one <hi>impos</hi> contradicts himſelf. For in his <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the Reader</hi> parag. the third, he confeſſeth, that of his knowledge <hi>many Diſcreet Gentlemen would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times condemn Aſtrologie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally this Epiſtle, and his whole book compared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether will ſufficiently argue, that the man was miſerably loſt in his reaſon when he pen'd it. For what are thoſe <hi>Aſtrologicall</hi> predictions that <hi>D. Homes</hi> levels his <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologie</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:121621:6"/>againſt, but of ſuch things, as which either <hi>they themſelves are</hi> (as to us) <hi>accidentall, as the ſucceſſe of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes, or their cauſes are internall, as mens wills, and free choiſe, as to undertake a journey, build,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or not.</hi> Thus D. <hi>Homes</hi> in his very entrance upon the point of Aſtrology; chap. 1. §. 1. and §. 2. And in the very next page, <hi>viz.</hi> 112. he allows <hi>conjecturing, and of things whereof any naturall reaſon can be yielded;</hi> as (ſaith he, quoting and conſenting with D. <hi>Willet</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>there are naturall ſignes in the ſimple bodies, as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and air, of the alteration of weather, as into winds, or rain, &amp;c. as alſo in compound bodies, either vegetable, of ſeaſons to ſet plants, or trees; or in humane bodies of convenient time to let blood, or purge. Theſe are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate effects in nature, of the Celeſtiall bodies. There are alſo mediate effects, as Comets, which ſhew ſiccity, heat, and combuſtion; ſo the Crow cryes againſt rain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the clammy moyſture of the air affects and afflicts him in the clinging of his feathers,</hi> &amp;c. But the <hi>Doctour</hi> doth there deny ſigns of <hi>humane events.</hi> So alſo in page 160. of his <hi>Demonologie</hi> he opens his he art wide to ſhew what he means by the <hi>Aſtrology</hi> againſt which he raiſeth his battery of reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> againſt <hi>ſuch an Art or Science</hi> (as <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> would have it called) <hi>that undertakes to predict and foretell what ſhall befall MEN, and CI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIES, and COMMON-WEALTHS, in relation to H<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>MANE affairs, ARBITRARY actings, SPONTANEO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S and voluntary tranſactions, that depend upon the movings of mens wills.</hi> To the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the <hi>Doctour</hi> ſpeaks in his 113, 165, 167, pages of his <hi>Demonologie.</hi> And therefore it is WILL. RAM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SEYS ILL CUSTOME OF TELLING UN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRUTH (to call it no worſe, though juſtly I might) to ſay, the <hi>Doctour or other Antagoniſts to Judiciall Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie know not, or do not ponere what they mean, when they ſpeak againſt Judiciall Aſtrologie.</hi> The Doctour as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:121621:6"/>clearly, as if written with Sun-beams, doth often inculcate what he allows, and what he diſallows, as even but now hath been plainly declared;<note place="margin">The ſtate of the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> adding oft in his <hi>Demono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie,</hi> that all <hi>Naturall Predictions</hi> (which the <hi>Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> would cram in to their <hi>Judiciall Aſtrologie,</hi> with contradiction enough) is to be called, and conſidered in a way of Art or Science, either as METEOROLOGIE, or PHYSIOLOGIE, or pure ASTRONOMIE according to the nature of the ſubject under conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>Thus you have heard the Doctour as plain (as they ſay) as a Pack-ſtaff; now let us hear what thoſe predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are that <hi>Will. Ramſey</hi> is pleaſed in his Epiſtle to the Reader to diſavow or grant. Which are the very ſame that the Doctour denyes or grants, and <hi>William</hi> ſpeaks them in higher words then the Doctour. I will give them unto you in his own words. His heads upon a juſt particular account are ſix. 1. Saith he, the <hi>rules</hi> of Aſtrologie <hi>doth</hi> (ſo <hi>W. Ramſey</hi> is pleaſed to joyn a Nown plurall and Verb ſingular together; but this is a ſmall matter with him, who after is miſerably out in his <hi>Latine, Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew.</hi> But for preſent, I was forced to touch his Engliſh upon whoſe ſcore it lyes, becauſe I promiſed to give you his mind in his own words) I ſay, <hi>Will. Ramſey</hi> ſaith in the firſt place, <q>that the rules of Aſtrology doth not meddle with <hi>vain contingencies;</hi> or ſuch as have an indifferent reſpect to the oppoſites, as depending upon unknown, or indeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate cauſes, which may happen one way or other. 2. <hi>Will. Ramſey</hi> ſaith, <hi>Mans will</hi> is not ſubject to the influence of the ſtars; neither hath Aſtrology to do with it, but accidentally ſo farre as the ſoul with the faculties thereof follow the temperature of the body,</q> which (the friends of Aſtrology themſelves acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) is impeded and altered ſo many wayes, as that Aſtrologicall predictions of <hi>man</hi> come to nothing. See
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:121621:7"/>the Doctours <hi>Demonologie</hi> chap. 10. §. 4. 3. <q>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth Aſtrologie meddle with the <hi>Providence of God.</hi> 4. Or ſhew cauſe of <hi>miracles.</hi> 5. Or med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles with the <hi>ſecrets</hi> of God, for they are paſt finding out. Aſtrologers are but men that contemplate <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cauſes.</hi> 6. Aſtrologie or the influence of ſtars have no <hi>fatall neceſſity,</hi> except ſome <hi>contingency</hi> be mixt therewith; for this were to deny the providence of God.</q> Thus <hi>W. Ramſey;</hi> whereof the laſt is delivered with that wonderfull <hi>contradiction</hi> of <hi>fatall neceſſity</hi> and <hi>contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you have them as he gives them.</p>
               <p>Now let the Reader that hath a mind to underſtand the right, compare the Doctours, and <hi>W. R.</hi> his ſtateing of the Queſtion together, and he ſhall find thoſe ſix things afore ſaid, ſet down by <hi>William</hi> in that his <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the Reader,</hi> fully to agree with the Doctours Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net in the main. Therefore <hi>W. R.</hi> in his great warfare in his enſuing Pamphlet againſt the <hi>Doctours Demonologie,</hi> either as a diſtracted man departs from his own princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; or elſe plainly fights againſt himſelf; let <hi>William</hi> take his choyſe.</p>
               <p>And if he be like ſome of his brethren he will chooſe the former. For however they ſtate the queſtion in <hi>words,</hi> I am ſure they practiſe in <hi>deeds</hi> quite contrary; underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to know by the ſtarres <hi>who, and where are the Theeves and ſtollen goods of ſuch, and ſuch a robbery; the cattle and Drovers that carried them away, from ſuch and ſuch a ground, at ſuch a time;</hi> and the like feits; and theſe they practiſe for money. Yea they are bold to predict the <hi>events of warres, the ſucceſſes of marriages, and thouſands</hi> of ſuch meer <hi>humane</hi> events, which the Scripture pronounceth uncertain to us. <hi>The battle is not to the ſtrong, nor the race to the ſwift. Promotion cometh not from the Eaſt</hi> (ſtarres) <hi>nor the VVeſt</hi> (ſtarres) &amp;c. but all fall out as Gods providence diſpoſeth. Yet thoſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologers
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:121621:7"/>will boldly undertake to predict ſuch things, as their <hi>Almanacks and Aſtrologicall Predictions,</hi> &amp;c. do teſtifie. By which writings they gain credit and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of miſerable ſeduced ſouls, to fee them and feed them with money for meer impoſtures, as many of their Clients do daily complain; ſaying, <hi>the Aſtrologers had their money</hi> (not forbearing to name the men and the money,) <hi>but they were never the neerer to find that they promiſed them.</hi> But if this were all that Aſtrologers did do, it were not ſo intolerable. But they have practiſed ſome things that are not to be indured in any Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, <hi>viz. to diſſwade men of quality from marrying worthy Gentlewomen, uſing lies for their arguments,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable practiſe of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers.</note> 
                  <hi>forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe things of the Gentlewomen, to diſinable their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and to reproch them in their repute, as are not fit here to be named; but at due time and place ſhall be made good before any Court of Juſtice by undenyable proof. And at the rate of</hi> Will. Ramſey's <hi>ſounding the Trumpet, the battle is likely ſpeedily to begin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>William Ramſey</hi> himſelf, for all his ſtateing of the queſtion aforeſaid, undertakes to predict many <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane events (quite without the ſphere of the ſtate of his queſtion) in his diſcourſe of the Eclipſe of the Sun at the</hi> end of his rayling reply to <hi>D. Homes his Demonologie.</hi> Amongſt the reſt he predicts,<note place="margin">In the laſt page ſave one.</note> that <hi>before that Eclipſe hath finiſhed its effects, Miniſters ſhall be in leſſe eſteem, then they would fain perſwade the vulgar, concerning the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in Aſtrology.</hi> Whatever the <hi>Epithets</hi> be he gives to <hi>Miniſters</hi> there; he intends not them for <hi>diſtinction,</hi> but for <hi>agnomination</hi> to them all, good as well as bad, or elſe he would not lay the cauſe of that prediction to be the <hi>Miniſters oppoſing Astrologers,</hi> and upbraid Doctour <hi>Homes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And let me tell thee <hi>William</hi> a propheſie out of the Word of God againſt Judiciall Aſtrologers,<note place="margin">A Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</note> that as <hi>Aarons</hi> rod ſwallowed up the <hi>Enchanters</hi> rods (Exod.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:121621:8"/>7.12); <hi>Balaam</hi> was killed when the <hi>Prieſts and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> of the Lord were preſerved (Numb. 13.22.); <hi>Daniel the Prophet</hi> is preſerved and honoured, when ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death was pronounced againſt the <hi>Aſtrologers,</hi> (Dan. 2. verſ. 2.14.27.28. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the end of the chapter): and the perſons having <hi>familiar ſpirits,</hi> and the <hi>Diviners,</hi> and Exorciſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> fell before the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> (<hi>Acts</hi> chap. 8. chap. 19. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>): So theſe laſt and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſort of wicked men, that lead poor ſouls from God to the Devill, from his word to their circles and figures ſhall (without repentance) according to all the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the old Teſtament againſt <hi>Aſtrologers, Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Enchanters, Sorcerers,</hi> &amp;c. quoted in the <hi>Doctours Demonologie,</hi> periſh with Antichriſt and all Chriſts ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at the great deſtruction of the wicked near approch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for making way for the Saints Triumph a while on earth over all their enemies, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.8. &amp; 22.15. Now <hi>William,</hi> and thy brethren, runne your courſe in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall Aſtrology,</hi> according to your wonted manner of practiſe at your perill; and venture it whither your <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipſe,</hi> or the light of our <hi>Sun</hi> (the word of God) will propheſie more truly.</p>
               <p>I wonder in what ſtarre or conſtellation, or their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures <hi>William</hi> could reade this goodly change, that godly Miniſters muſt be diſcountenanced, and lying Aſtrologers (as the Scripture calls them) ſhall be advanced? His telling me there of <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> to a <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> of ♄ <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with many the like anticks, figures, gibberiſh and cantings, is leſſe, is worſe then nothing, unleſſe he could demonſtrate to me (for that's the honour of a <hi>true Mathematician</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate moſt potently) by <hi>reaſon,</hi> why ſuch poſtures and features of ſtarres and conſtellations muſt needs pre-ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie ſuch and ſuch events,<note place="margin">Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strationes Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticae <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

To tell me of <hi>Traditions,</hi> that of old time for many generations upon ſuch ſigns, ſuch events have come to paſſe; is no more (if <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> ſay true
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:121621:8"/>in that) then what <hi>Conjurers</hi> teach and practiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> draw ſuch and ſuch circles, making theſe and thoſe figures, with uſing of this poſture and that form of words and the ſpirit will riſe at command; which, though true, is called by the conſent of all good men, <hi>conjuring,</hi> and is diabolicall, becauſe there can be no naturall reaſon given of it, nor a divine rule to juſtifie it. The application in a due proportion is obvious.</p>
               <p>If thus therefore <hi>Judiciall Aſtrologers</hi> (as ye call them) do conſtantly in their practiſe tranſgreſſe againſt <hi>W. Ramſey's</hi> ſtateing the queſtion (in his ſaid Epiſtle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Chriſtian <hi>Judiciall Aſtrology,</hi> as with a ſtrong contradiction in <hi>adjecto</hi> he calls it) <hi>William</hi> hath little reaſon to weary the readers eyes and ears with irkſome and nauſeous repetition of that common rule (liable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to exception) <hi>Abuſe ſhould not take away the uſe;</hi> or that inſtance, <hi>Hereſies crept into Religion, ſhould not put away Religion.</hi> We have a Bible for our Religion; no Scripture for <hi>Judiciall Aſtrologie,</hi> as before ſtated. And other <hi>Aſtrology</hi> (if they will have it ſo called) that is <hi>naturall,</hi> not meddling with the ſix particulars aforeſaid (as <hi>W.

You heard afore by <hi>Auſtin</hi> of himſelf and others, and by Maſter <hi>Perkins,</hi> and M. <hi>Brigges</hi> (in the <hi>Doctours</hi> Treatiſe of <hi>Demonologie</hi>) that <hi>Aſtrology</hi> hath an innate tendency further, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond an immoration within the bounds of <hi>Naturalls,</hi> and therefore they repented of their ſtudies in that way. For that which conſtantly ends in unlawful practiſe, argues the principles to be naught. If a thing were once of good uſe, but now of none, but of much abuſe, that's warrant for lawfull ſtate-powers to remove it; and <hi>Hezekiah's breaking in pieces the brazen Serpent will juſtifie it.</hi>

ONE, which is firſt in order and power, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we apprehend at all times the motions of the Sun and Moon and other Starrs, and their poſtures amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or towards the Earth. The OTHER is that, whereby we conſider by the natural qualities of the Starrs the changes that are wrought in Bodies that are congruous to thoſe poſtures. And of theſe doctrines, the FORMER hath its proper Art, albeit the end of the SECOND be not added unto it, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which words moſt evidently, <hi>Ptolomy</hi> diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Aſtronomy</hi> from <hi>Aſtrologie</hi> of the neareſt kinde, <hi>viz.

OU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RANOSCOPIE, or URANOLOGIE, or OURANOGRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHIE (the <hi>genus</hi>) is either <hi>Aſtronomy</hi> or <hi>Aſtrology,</hi>

For the <hi>Doctour</hi> allows it (as I have ſhewed) onely he would have it called by another name, as a part of another Science. If he means <hi>Judiciall;</hi> then he plainly equivocates, defining one kind, but proſecutes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>VV.

                  <p>Having thus painted forth the matter and form of the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:121621:12"/>thing intended to be inſiſted on, I come now to ſhew you what M. <hi>Homes</hi> his utmoſt power and malice againſt it is: and firſt his blind zeal begins to ſhew it ſelf, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading the Reader it is condemned by the Scripture, and no wiſe thereby tolerated; his words are, <hi>It is no where allowed in the Scripture, under the notion of</hi> Aſtrology, <hi>but every where ſpoken againſt as we ſhall ſee afterward:</hi> and all that he can ſhew us and make us ſee, is but ſix places of Scripture,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> which is far from being worthy of the Title of a generall condemnation, when there is none but knows the extent of the Scripture to conſiſt of many half dozen Chapters, nay of Books, <hi>Ergo,</hi> not every where condemned; and thoſe places neither, but imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by him to condemn <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> when indeed they ſerve no whit at all for his purpoſe, as in its due place ſhall be made appear. But by the way,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> is it every where condemned? doth not the King and Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſay, <hi>The heavens declare the glory of God, Pſal.</hi> 19.1? and in another place, <hi>The language of the ſtars,</hi> (which is the ſignification of the word <hi>Aſtrology</hi>

One of theſe places had been enough to have convinced him of great wickedneſſe, in denying the Scripture doth any where allow of Aſtrology; for if he never read theſe places, then he is wicked, and no leſſe then wilfully wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, to conclude what he underſtands not; if he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed them, then moſt malicious to ſpeak againſt truth; I may even as well ſay diabolically wicked, and that he
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:121621:13"/>teacheth rather the Doctrine of Devils, for the Devils Doctrine is falſhood; and if he preacheth ſuch groſs lyes as theſe, he is the Devils Preacher, and not Aſtrologers: neither is Aſtrology a Doctrine of Devils (as ſhall he made clear to him before the cloſure of my Diſcourſe) as he in his 160. <hi>page line</hi> 21. is pleaſed to terme it. So then, now I hope the Reader doth clearly ſee, theſe his firſt words of his Diſcourſe, to be meerly envious, ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous, and malicious, or (at the beſt) moſt ignorant; for it will puzzle all his brains, and M. <hi>Raunces,</hi> nay and all that dare or will take their parts, to make any one of thoſe paſſages of Scripture (he brings to confute or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn Aſtrology) to ſerve in the leaſt for his turn, as in its due place ſhall be cleared.</p>
                  <p>Then ſaith M. <hi>Homes, As other things that are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, which are brought to countenance</hi> Aſtrology, <hi>are not tolerated by the</hi> Encyclopaedia, <hi>and general order and Seats of all Arts and Sciences within their own Spheres, to be accounted</hi> Aſtrology. For inſtance, Firſt, (ſaith he) <hi>Some urge that we know the Tides of the Sea, by the ſtate of <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, and Tempeſts by other Stars.</hi> which I am confident M. <hi>Homes</hi> cannot deny, but he will render himſelf more ridiculous then already, which he endeavours to do thus; <hi>Theſe and of the like nature, are properly handled in that part of natural Philoſophy, which we call</hi> Meteorology; <hi>and ſo likewiſe are all fiery Meteors, Comets, &amp;c. and ſo by conſequence are made an integrall part of Phyſicks: for if you will ſay, becauſe of their external efficient cauſe.</hi> viz. <hi>the Starrs, they are to be handled as a part of</hi> Aſtrology, <hi>by the ſame reaſon there will be left no ſuch Science as natural Philoſophy, becauſe all inferiour Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies below the Moon (as ſaith the great Philoſopher</hi> Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle) <hi>depend upon the ſuperiour Celeſtial bodies of the Heavens.</hi> In all which he doth but ſhew his great miſtake in the ground of Aſtrology, and his envie thereto; for how can M. <hi>Homes</hi> prove this is a meer urging, or an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:121621:13"/>of ſome, that the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> is the cauſe of the ebbing and flowing of the Sea; or that it is rather to be attributed to that part of natural Philoſophy, which is called <hi>Meteo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rologie,</hi> and ſo conſequently to be a part of Phyſicks; when all the World knows, that hath any experience or underſtanding in Aſtrology, that he is as far from hitting the mark, as if he had miſt the Butt.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore for his better inſtruction, (for I ſee he is not ſo well verſt in Aſtrology as he pretendeth, or as one that is to condemn it ſhould be) I will make it appear to him, that the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> is the abſolute cauſe of the ebbing and flowing of the Sea; and this is the opinion of all or moſt knowing and learned Writers, both in this Art and other Sciences; and not onely ſo, but it is ſo clear to all the Learned, that his great Friend <hi>Picus Mirandula,</hi> which was a ſtronger Champion (or at leaſt more knowing in the Art then he) againſt Aſtrology, doth confeſs the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> to be the poſitive and ſole cauſe thereof.</p>
                  <p>And thus, if he have any underſtanding in the Art (as by his writing, I muſt confeſs (as I now but ſaid) I ſee none) let him take the true time of the Seas flowing firſt, and then obſerve in what part of Heaven the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> is acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally placed by her violent diurn motion, and he ſhall finde it to flow till ſhe come to an abſolute <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> aſpect of the place ſhe was in at the firſt beginning to flow; and then will continue ebbing till ſhe come to the direct ☍ or oppoſite place in the Heavens <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Still let him obſerve exactly when ſhe comes to the <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> or ☍ of the place of her firſt beginning, and he ſhall never err in this point. This is ſufficiently well known to the learned Practitioners, and the ſons of Art: yet note that ☉ and other Starrs may haſten, hinder, and alter the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> influence, as he may ſee at ☌ and ☍ of ☉, or the Change and Full; in Spring-tides, and Neap-tides, at quarters and half-quarters. I would he had not been ignorant of this, and then perhaps, (this being the beginning of his diſcourſe) he had not undertook
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:121621:14"/>to lay Pen to Paper againſt this moſt heavenly, moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, and moſt contemplative, delectable Study and Science of the Stars and Celeſtial Bodies. So by this time he clearly ſees how inconſiderate and raſh this his ſophiſtical and faſe argument is.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſaith M. <hi>Homes, Others ſay that by Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie we know Eclipſes and Changes of the Moon; but we ſay Astronomy doth challenge this as belonging to it, &amp;c.</hi> My anſwer is, that I ſay, (what ever he telleth me others may or do ſay) he cannot but know that thoſe that ſay ſo are not verſed therein, and are ignorant.</p>
                  <p>And thirdly, ſaith he, <hi>If any one urge that Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie handles of the Qualities and Effects of the Stars,</hi> we reply, <hi>that ſo doth Astronomy, of their Qualities, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of their light and colour, and natural Philoſophy of their Effects, in watery, aiery, and fiery Meteors:</hi> as much as to ſay, Aſtrology is no Science at all, but will give its property to another Study; if this be not ſlander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and malicious, let the weakeſt in the world judge: he might as well then all this while have called it, Natural Philoſophy, as Aſtrologie. And then he tels us, if we admit of the Title <hi>Alsted gives to Astrologie,</hi> viz. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologia planetaria,</hi> or Planetary Aſtrology, and of Doctor <hi>VVillets</hi> Titles, <hi>viz. Astromancy &amp; Genethliaca;</hi> then ſaith he for concluſion by all obſerve, <hi>that there is no place left for Astrologie:</hi> by which he clearly renders himſelf the moſt malicious of all <hi>wretches,</hi> to deny that Art, which above 298. of the moſt wiſe of all Ages have ſtudied and practiſed (their names you ſhall have hereafter in its place;) both before and ſince Chriſts time; whoſe antiquity may be derived from our firſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Adam:</hi> maintained by Princes and Kings; reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by that greateſt of Worthies, <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great; and not condemned by any of the Fathers; or the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice thereof prohibited by the Church, farther then that they ſhould not hereby be drawn from the ſtudy of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:121621:14"/>as you ſhall ſee by and by. M. <hi>Homes</hi> me thinks being <hi>a wiſe man,</hi> ſhould not write againſt, (and that in ſuch a zealous manner) a thing which is not in <hi>rerum na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura,</hi> or in <hi>poſſe,</hi> as in his firſt Section of his tenth Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, he ſtudies to make Aſtrologie appear; to what purpoſe then are all his arguments againſt Aſtrologie, when he will not admit of any ſuch thing in the world? what doth he write againſt then? and why doth he ſo much condemn the ſtudents thereof? Becauſe he knows not the validity thereof; becauſe he knows not the rules and fundamentals thereof; becauſe indeed he is altogether ignorant of the ſame; and let him not be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry I plainly tell him ſo, (plain dealing is beſt among friends) for if he did, he would have been ſo far from writing or ſpeaking againſt it, that he would have been more furious and hot with any one ſhould have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned it. then I am with him.<note place="margin">Railers are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall, yea De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. 1 Tim. 3.11. 2 Tim. 3.3.

                  <p>SURVEY. One would wonder to hear <hi>VV.

Therefore whether of the twain appears to be more <hi>diabolicall,</hi> let the Reader judge. And 'tis as great a wonder to ſee the <hi>Doctours</hi> Treatiſe of <hi>Astrology</hi> ſo orderly digeſted into Sections, and <hi>VVilliam Ramſey</hi> to ſo leap from the one to the other, as if he were confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his apprehenſion; or elſe that he would fain rather cooſen the Reader, then clear the controverſie. But to the matter.</p>
                  <p>To that marked with <hi>(A)</hi> we ſay, It is enough to make it a ſpeech of truth, and a true confutation of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie; that whereſoever the Scriptures mention Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, there the Scriptures alſo diſallow it: which they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow in more then ſix places of Scripture, or <hi>ſeven,</hi> as the Doctour hath obſerved (if <hi>VVilliam</hi> reckons right) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Doctour reduced them all to ſeven heads.</p>
                  <p>To that at the letter <hi>(B)</hi> it is ſo weak a proof of a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:121621:15"/>Scripture allowance of Aſtrology, that it is not worthy the anſwering; onely I am willing to make <hi>W. Ramſey</hi> ſee it, if I can. For the <hi>Heavens declare the glory of God</hi> (as 'tis preſently there expounded) as they are Gods <hi>Handy-work.</hi> But the inference of <hi>William;</hi> The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens declare Gods glory, therefore Aſtrology is lawfull, is ſo ridiculous as that with the bare naming of it, it is confuted. For <hi>THE LANG<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>AGE OF THE STARS</hi> which <hi>William</hi> ſaith, is in <hi>another place,</hi> I am ſure is <hi>IN NO PLACE OF CANONICAL SCRIPT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RE.</hi> For <hi>Williams</hi> Expoſition on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.3. it muſt give place to the Apoſtles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.18. <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Preaching the Goſpel,</hi> not of Aſtrology. For the <hi>Pleiades</hi> in <hi>Job;</hi> they are anſwered after.

                  <p>To that of W. <hi>Ramſey</hi> marked with <hi>(C)</hi> and from thence to the end of this Section, we need onely ſay thus. That <hi>William</hi> is toyling at the <hi>Labour in vain,</hi> to ſhew the Doctour that <hi>the Moon is the cauſe of the ebbing and flowing of the Sea;</hi> who knew it afore ever <hi>William</hi> did, and it is granted by him in his <hi>Demonologie,</hi> (if <hi>William</hi> will ſee) onely he ſaith, other Sciences ſhew that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of <hi>Judicial Aſtrologie.</hi>

                  <p>And to that audaciouſneſs of <hi>William Ramſey</hi> daring to ſay in the face of all learned men (that ſhall ſee his Pamphlet) <hi>That thoſe that ſay we know Eclipſes, and Changes of the Moon by Aſtronomy,</hi>

                     <hi>A Repetition of Doctour</hi> Homes <hi>his SECTION I.</hi> Of the nature of Aſtrology in ſome diſtinctions, deſcriptions, and obſervations.</head>
                  <p>IF I ſhould diſtinguiſh of <hi>Aſtrology</hi> as <hi>Alſted</hi> doth, calling it, <hi>Aſtrologia Judiciaria,</hi> that is, <hi>Judiciall Aſtrology,</hi> as Maſter <hi>Perkins,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Geree</hi> call it; or ſhould I diſtinguiſh as Doctour <hi>VVillet,</hi> that this Art is partly <hi>Theorical,</hi> partly <hi>Practical,</hi> and the <hi>practical</hi> is partly <hi>allowed,</hi> and partly <hi>rejected;</hi> as if hereby we would ſeparate and ſet apart for lawfull uſe, the <hi>name</hi> and <hi>thing of any kind of Aſtrology;</hi> 'tis of our indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and more then we need to do. For keeping to our terms, either firſt to the term <hi>Aſtrology;</hi> it is no where allowed in the Scripture, under that notion, but every where ſpoken againſt, as we ſhall ſee afterward. As o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things that are naturall, which are brought to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance Aſtrology, are not tolerated by the <hi>Encyclopaediae,</hi> and generall order, and ſeats of all Arts and Sciences, within their own ſphears, to be accounted Aſtrology.</p>
                  <p>For inſtance; firſt, ſome urge that we know the <hi>Tides of the Sea by the ſtate of the Moon;</hi> and <hi>tempeſts by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Stars,</hi> &amp;c. But theſe, and of the like nature, ſay we, are properly handled in that part of <hi>natural Philoſophy</hi> which we call <hi>Meteorology;</hi> as alſo are all fiery Meteors, Comets, &amp;c. of all which the eſſentiall internall cauſes, <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>form,</hi> and one externall, namely the <hi>end,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long thereunto, are there handled, and thereby are made an integral part of <hi>Phyſicks.</hi> For if you will ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their externall efficient cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Stars, they are to be handled as a part of <hi>Aſtrology:</hi> by the ſame reaſon there will be left no ſuch Science as <hi>naturall Philoſophy,</hi> becauſe all inferiour bodies below the Moon
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:121621:16"/>(as ſaith the great Philoſopher <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) depend upon the ſuperiour Celeſtiall bodies of the Heavens.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others ſay, that by Aſtrology we know <hi>Eclipſes,</hi> and changes of the Moon: But ſay we, <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy</hi> doth challenge this, whoſe proper work is to teach us the Sphears, Planets, and nominated fixed Stars, with their motions, meaſures, diſtances, conjunctions and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions; whence ariſe Eclipſes of the Sun, or Stars, and changes of the Moon. I give but a touch upon ſome particulars, as an hint to underſtanding men to conceive of the reſt. Thirdly, If any urge that Aſtrology han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles of the <hi>qualities</hi> and <hi>effects</hi> of the Stars: We reply, that ſo doth Aſtronomy of <hi>their qualities;</hi> namely, of their light and colour; and naturall Philoſophy of their <hi>effects</hi> in watery, aiery, and fiery Meteors.</p>
                  <p>Or ſecondly, if we admit of another term, or title which <hi>Alſted</hi> gives to <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> calling it, <hi>Aſtrologiae Planetaria, i. e.</hi> Planetary Aſtrology; then we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand what becomes of almoſt all the Syſtem of pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Aſtrology, if its ground work be founded mainly on the Planets, the main part of Aſtronomy? What then becomes of the notions about the tenth Orb, the twelve houſes of the Heavens, the twelve Signs, with hundreds more of ſuch kind of knacks wherewith they are wont to build up Aſtrology?</p>
                  <p>Or thirdly, If we entertain thoſe other terms and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles that <hi>Alſted,</hi> and Doctour <hi>Willet,</hi> &amp;c. give to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrology, calling it <gap reason="foreign">

So likewiſe <hi>Averroës</hi> in his Commentary on the 12. of the <hi>Metaphyſicks,</hi> text 44. ſpeaking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the power of the heavenly bodies, in the procreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and conſervation of all worldly things, and in their mutual conſent, and aſſiſting one another in their mutual operations, he reſembleth them to good Governours in a Common-wealth, that joyntly concur in one unanimous conſent for ordering the ſame: His words are, <hi>Diſpoſitio in juvamento corporum coeleſtium ad invicem in creando en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, quae ſunt hîc, &amp; conſervando ea, eſt ſicut diſpoſitio re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentium bonorum, qui juvant ſe adinvicem in regendo bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam eivitatem.</hi> And in his Commentary on the ſecond Book of Phyſicks, his ſecond Chapter, ſheweth that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Philoſophy and Aſtrology have one and the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and yet are diſtinguiſhed by a divers conſideration. And in the third of the <hi>Metaph.

I believe M. <hi>Homes</hi> nor no man elſe that knoweth any thing, will deny that it is one of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral Sciences, &amp; if he will condemn it as none, he muſt be content to loſe one of them, which were to render himſelf

                  <head>W. R. his <hi>SECT. IV.</hi> Proving the lawfulneſs of Astrologie, being not impugned by the Scripture, nor Councils; but allowed of by the wiſest and greatest men.</head>
                  <p>VVHat hath already above been ſaid, is clear to any judicious impartial eye, that this Art is lawfull, where I ſay, <hi>The Heavens declare the Glory of God, &amp;c.</hi> But to clear it more plainly, the Pſalmiſt in his very next words ſaith, <hi>The Firmament ſheweth the works
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:121621:19"/>of his hands, Pſalm.</hi> 19.1. which is clear to me is meant thereby that he effecteth by them, (and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing) (though I muſt confeſs there are divers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations thereof) my reaſon is, that otherwiſe, every thing which is created doth declare the handy work of God; I believe Maſter <hi>Homes</hi> will finde <hi>Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Hierome</hi> of my opinion: He hath heard alſo, that there is no ſpeech nor ſanguage, where the voice of the Starrs are not heard, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.3. which may ſerve here again very well for the purpoſe in hand; and to ſpeak more plainly, that God doth not prohibit mortals from the ſtudy of them; you may ſee how the holy Ghoſt by <hi>Stephen,</hi> in the 7. of the <hi>Acts, verſ.</hi> 22. ſpeaking in the commendation of <hi>Moſes,</hi> giveth him (over and above the commendation that was aforeſaid) that he was learned <hi>in all the wiſedom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and deeds,</hi> which is clear to any rational man, that if it had been any wiſe ſinfull, dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical, or odious in the ſight of God, <hi>Moſes</hi> would not have applied his ſtudy thereunto; or at leaſt, it would never have been recorded in his praiſe. I might inſtance here <hi>Daniel, Solomon,</hi> and others, but this is ſo clear, that to inſiſt longer hereon, were but vain, ſince there is no one place in the Scripture that can be ſhown to ſpeak po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively againſt Aſtrology, or the ſtudy thereof, more then to remember us not to give the glory of the Creatour to the Creature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as in the anſwer to his divine proofs ſhall appear. Wherefore then ſince it is warrantable and lawfull out of the Scripture to ſtudy this Art, nay and as we ſee by experience, warranted by God, in the ſhewing of blazing Starrs to Aſtrologers onely (not to the vulgar and proficient in other Arts) to forewarn the people of the danger and puniſhment to come; and if it were not ſo he might as well ſhew ſignes on earth to the illiterate, by common vulgar things; as in heaven to the learned Aſtrologer, who onely can judge of the effects. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:121621:19"/>then I ſay, of neceſſity the Art muſt be allowed of by Councils, being the wiſer ſort of people, eſpecially by the godlier ſort of Councils, whoſe acts and determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will be grounded on piety and the Word of God, and if otherwiſe; I value not what their cenſure is; for they are but men and (guided by their own reaſons and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) are but frail ſubject to infirmity and errour, <hi>Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num eſt errare.</hi> He cannot but know alſo that even the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pableſt truths have been condemned by Councils, either for ſome ſelf-intereſt, or for abuſe of the thing condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as for inſtance, the <hi>Bacaran</hi> Councils (as well as the Roman Senate) hath condemned Aſtrologers, but how? not becauſe they were Students in that heavenly Science, but for truſting in Aſtrology; (and who is ſo ſuperſtitious, may not lawfully be termed an Aſtrologer, for Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers are in no ſort hereof guilty) the words of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil is in the <hi>Cap.</hi> 9. of <hi>Bacaran</hi> Councils, <hi>Si quis animas, &amp; corpora humana fatalibus ſtellis credit adſtringi, ſicut pagani &amp; Priſcillianus dixerunt, anathema ſit, Who ſo truſteth in the fatal neceſſity of the Stars, as the Heathens and Priſcillianiſts do or ſay, let him be accurſt.</hi> To al which, there is no Aſtrologer, but will willingly conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend; for by this, is not Aſtrology nor Aſtrologers in the leaſt condemned, but the abuſe of the Art, to give that to it, which properly belongs to God the Creatour of theſe heavenly bodies; the decree is againſt thoſe that truſt in them, or believe a fatal neceſſity, not that ſtudy the knowledge of them, and make a true uſe of them. So likewiſe the Council or Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> made a Law againſt thoſe that multiplied Gold and Silver, why? not becauſe they condemned that heavenly revelation, or practiſe of the <hi>moſt bleſſed Stone of the Philoſophers,</hi> but they forbad the multiplication of Gold and Silver, in that they thought it too great a treaſure for any private ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and to prevent rebellion, commotions and inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Common-wealth, like wiſe Pilots ſitting at the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:121621:20"/>Stern, did ſtudy to prevent the Storm which was likely otherwiſe to ſhipwrack the ſafety thereof. So that I ſay then, there is no Council, (if they have any ſpark of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Learning or Policy) that will ſhew themſelves ſo ridiculous, as to decree any thing in the leaſt, againſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Aſtrologers or Aſtrology, taking it as it is in it ſelf, and not abuſed; which is not the fault in the Art, but the Artiſt in going beyond the Art; for if under the colour of Aſtrology, I ſtudy Necromancy, is Aſtrology therefore to be condemned as unlawfull, becauſe together with it I ſtudy unlawfull Arts? No ſure, ſince this is a thing ſo far different; therefore it is good to put the Saddle on the right Horſe.</p>
                  <p>And this my argument is thus confimed, for that in former ages, both the greateſt and wiſeſt ſort of people were Practitioners and Students in Aſtrology; as firſt we may ſee by the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> amongſt whom it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for any man to take the function of Prieſthood on him, except he were an Aſtrologer; nor could any be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen King, except he were of the Colledge of Prieſts. And <hi>Rhodiginus</hi> reporteth that for the prevention of Treaſon, there was none born within that Kingdom, whoſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity was not brought to the King to be judged on. And <hi>Dion</hi> recordeth the ſame to be practiſed by <hi>Tiberius;</hi> and we ſee in <hi>Daniel,</hi> that the Monarchs of <hi>Babylon</hi> attempted nothing of importance, without firſt asking counſel of the <hi>Chaldeans.</hi> And the Kings of <hi>Lacedaemonia</hi> had none in their Councils neither were any ſuffered to ſit, but who were Aſtrologers: and alſo among the <hi>Perſians,</hi> none was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Crown, but who were excellently skilled in Aſtrology; nay, to this day there is no King but hath his Mathematician about him. So then, it is cleared, that there is no Council but what is ignorant of Art and Religion, that will condemn or decree any thing againſt Aſtrology, and how it hath been eſteemed amongſt the wiſeſt and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the people. And that ye may be the better confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:121621:20"/>in what hath been already ſaid; I will give the names of moſt of the chiefeſt Patriarks, Fathers, Kings, Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and Philoſophers, (according as that worthy and noble Sir <hi>Christopher Heyden</hi> ſets them down at the latter end of his Book, in defence of Judicial Aſtrology) that have been Students in this noble Art.</p>

We muſt ſay,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Aquinas</hi>) <hi>as hath been ſaid afore</hi> (Art. 1.2.) <hi>the operation of the Devil doth pour in it ſelf into that divination which proceeds from a falſe and vain opinion, to the end that he may inwrap the mindes of men in vanity or falſehood. And if any
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:121621:21"/>man will fore-know future things by the conſideration of the Starrs, which by them cannot be fore known, he is the man that follows a vain, and falſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Therefore we muſt conſider, what of future things may be fore-known by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection into the Starrs. And indeed as concerning thoſe things which come to paſs by neceſſity, it is manifest that they may be fore-known by conſideration of the Stars; as Astrologers do foretell Eclipſes. The diſpoſitions and motions of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Bodies, cannot be reduced unto one common cauſe which is natural; but may be reduced unto one common cauſe, which is divine providence. But the motions and ſituations of the heavenly bodies are by divine providence diſpoſed one way, and the events of future contingencies ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; becauſe, the former are diſpoſed according to the manner of neceſſity, that they always come to paſs, and after the ſame manner. But the later, after the way of contingency, that they happen va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly. From whence it cannot be, that the foreknowledge of future things can be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by inſpection into the Starrs, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then as effects are fore-known by their cauſes. Now there are two ſorts of effects that are exempted from the efficacy of the celestial bodies.</hi> 1. <hi>All effects that happen by accident, whether in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, or natural things: becauſe as 'tis proved in the ſixth of Metaphyſicks, an entity by accident hath no cauſe, eſpecially natural, ſuch as is the vertue of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:121621:22"/>bodies. Becauſe that which is by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is neither an entity properly, nor an oneneſs; as for example, whiles a ſtone is falling there is an Earthquake,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For theſe and the like things are not ſimply one, but abſolutely many. Now the operation of Nature is always terminated unto ſome one thing, even as it doth flow from one principle, which is the natural form of the thing.</hi> 2. <hi>The acts of free will (which is a faculty of the will and reaſon) are exempted from the efficacy of the heavenly bodies. For the intellect, or reaſon is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a body, nor the act of a corporeal or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, and by conſequence, neither is the will, which is within the reaſon; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Philoſopher in his third Book of the ſoul. Now no bodily thing can make an impreſſion upon an incorporeal thing, Whence it follows, that IT IS IM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POSSIBLE THAT THE HEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VENLY BODIES CAN DI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RECTLY MAKE AN IM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PRESS <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>PON THE <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>N<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DERSTANDING AND THE WILL. For this were to make the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding not to differ from ſenſe. From whence it follows, that the heavenly bodies cannot be a cauſe</hi> per ſe <hi>of the actings of free will, yet may they diſpoſingly incline to this, ſo farr as they impreſs upon mans body, and by conſequence, upon the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive powers, which are acts of the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral organs, which incline to humane acts. Yet becauſe THE SENSITIVE POWERS ARE OBEDIENT
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:121621:22"/>TO REASON (as appears by the Philoſopher in his</hi> 3. <hi>book of the ſoul, and in his</hi> 1. <hi>book of Manners</hi>) NO NE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CESSITY HEREBY IS IM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POSED UPON THE SPON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TANEOUS WILL, BUT A MAN CAN ACT CONTRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY TO THE INCLINATI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON OF THE CELESTIAL BODIES, BY THE POWER OF HIS REASON. <hi>Therefore,</hi> IF ANY MAN <hi>ſhall make uſe of the</hi> CONSIDERATION OF THE STARRS <hi>to foreknow</hi> CASUAL, <hi>or</hi> CONTINGENT EVENTS, <hi>or alſo to know with certainty the</hi> FU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURE WORKS OF MEN, <hi>this proceedeth from a falſe and vain opinion, and ſo the</hi> OPERA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION OF THE DEVIL INTER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MINGLES IT SELF, <hi>from whence the divination is</hi> SUPERSTITIOUS AND UNLAWFULL.</q> Thus farr <hi>Aquinas;</hi> on whom commenting we have learned, and profound <hi>Caje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> to boot. <hi>Et ex his patet</hi> (ſaith <hi>Cajetan</hi>) <hi>quomodo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligendum est, &amp;c.</hi> that is, <q>

For if theſe things be applied for a certainty of knowledge of contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies; or (which is the ſame thing) if we muſt uſe ſuch a figure of the Nativity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as a law, they are diabolical and condemned. And this <hi>Auſtin</hi> intends in his fourth book of his Confeſſions. But if they be onely to attain a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture of natural inclinations, they are not evil.

                     <hi>William Ramſey's</hi> proof in this Section, that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary Aſtrology is not condemned by the Word of God, is onely his paſſing his Word for it, which is worth nothing, for how unable he is to keep his Word will appear after.

                  <p>VVE have ſeen already how Aſtrology hath been proved lawfull by the Scripture and reaſon, not condemned by Councils, but admired and honoured in all ages, by the wiſeſt of the ancients; we come now to ſhew its antiquity, and from whence it had its firſt original: Concerning this point, there hath been much controverſie amongſt Writers, but moſt hold, that it was firſt revealed to man in the infancy of the World by God; <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> deriveth it from the <hi>Egyptians, Tully</hi> from the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> others from the <hi>Sidonians, Chaldeans, Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Indians, Arabians,</hi> and <hi>Greeks;</hi> but however it is moſt certain, if we will believe the ancienteſt Hiſtoriogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, that the Prieſts and Kings amongſt the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> among the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> the <hi>Magicians</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

But <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. deriveth it from <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Seth:</hi> and that they taught it to their poſterity, and that <hi>Seth</hi> was ſo well skilled therein, that foreſeeing thereby the deſtruction of the World, firſt by Water, then by Fire, leaſt the knowledge ſhould periſh by the Flood, engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it in two Pillers, the one of Stone, the other of Brick; and he farther witneſſeth <hi>that of Stone to remain in</hi> Syria <hi>in his own time;</hi> and in the 3.

                  <p>Secondly, for Natural Philoſophy, it bringeth no leſs help hereunto, then to the former, for hereby the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher cometh to know God the upholder, and immoveable Greatour of all things, by the conſtant inchangeable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Heavens; and the corruption and generation of all things, by the motion of ☉, <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> and other Planets
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:121621:26"/>in the Zodiack; and that there is a certain prefixt time of every ones life that is born, allotted by the Starrs, and that this is divers according to the nature of every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation, and the meaſure of every proper revolution; as alſo the reaſon of the ebbing and flowing of the Sea, by the motion of <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>. He comes alſo by Aſtrology to know the riſing of Meteors, the motion of Comets, and innurnerable other things, much conducing to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of his knowledge, experience, and skill. But this is ſo clear, I haſten to what is further to be ſaid in the praiſe and utility of Aſtrology, leaſt I ſpend too much time in confuting ſuch weak ſtuff, as is this diſcourſe of M. <hi>Homes,</hi> againſt ſo apparent a noble and excellent Art.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for Phyſick; for all that knows any thing in Aſtrology, can acquaint M. <hi>Homes,</hi> as alſo his great friend <hi>Galen</hi> (as moſt falſely he accuſes him (in his 115. <hi>page</hi>) to condemn Aſtrology as Sophiſtical, when indeed he himſelf appears no other at the beſt, to wrong ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy a man,) That he that ſhall adminiſter Phyſick when the Sun comes to the Equinoctial points, or in the Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular or Dog-dayes and the like, knows very little in the one or the other, <hi>viz.</hi> Phyſick or Aſtrology; and is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be accounted a fool then a Phyſician; and further, <hi>Galen</hi> admoniſheth men not to truſt themſelves with that Phyſician that is not verſed in Aſtrology; and <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocates</hi> alſo ſaith, that that Phyſician which is ignorant in Aſtrology, is not fully, nor can he be perfectly known in his Art; for without Aſtrology, he ſhall never be able to give Phyſick ſafely, <hi>viz.</hi> when to purge by evacuation or vomit, or Phlebotomy, or for what humours, or in what quantity, neither can he know or come to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the chief Piller of his Art, <hi>viz.</hi> the true cauſe of the Malady without it, neither with it, (if well learned therein) can he err: Beſides <hi>Galen</hi> further affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that Phyſick given at unſeaſonable times, doth not
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:121621:27"/>onely little avail or help, but oftentimes prove very hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, even to the endangering of the life of the Patient; and that theſe times are onely to be known and judged by the Starrs. <hi>Fernelius</hi> (a learned Phyſician) doth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto alſo condeſcend, as alſo <hi>Ficinus;</hi> for there is nothing more certain, then that Aſtrology doth plainly deliver Rules for all the parts of Phyſick aboveſaid, (which M. <hi>Homes</hi> I am confident (if any whit read therein) dare not but confeſs) and not onely ſo, but alſo teacheth the critical dayes, without which they cannot be known with any certainty; wherefore it is, that thoſe Phyſicians igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in Aſtrology, conclude the ſeventh and fourteenth dayes to be dangerous, when moſt times they are deceived, and ſo conſequently apply contrary Remedies to their Patients, much to their prejudice, if not abſolute deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the reaſon is, the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> by her various motion cometh ſometimes ſooner, and ſometimes later, to her <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> and ☍ or quadrat and oppoſite part of the place ſhe was in at the beginning of the Diſeaſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Sometimes ſhe comes to her <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> in ſeven dayes, ſometimes not till the eighth or ninth day, other times at the ſixth day; and to her ☍ ſometimes at the fourteenth day, ſometimes at the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, other times not till the ſixteenth day. I would fain now M. <hi>Homes,</hi> you would ſhew what Art in the whole earth, is more beneficial to Phyſick, then Aſtrologie <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but I haſten to the remaining proofs.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, for Health, which none but the moſt ignorant and malicious will deny, ſince the conſtitution of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is the onely ground, wiſe Phyſicians go upon, and look firſt to; that that foundation being laid, they may then fall to the rebuilding of the Patient, otherwiſe (as you have heard) deſtruction (like a houſe founded on the ſand) is to be expected. Then conſequently the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious cannot but confeſs and acknowledge it to be the moſt profitable thing for our health under the Sun. Wherefore then let us ſee whether the Husbandman will
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:121621:27"/>acknowledge it to be beneficial to him in the way of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, <hi>viz.</hi> Husbandry.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Husbandry, and firſt let me ask him, whether he lops his Trees from the time the Sun declines from our Horizon, till he again re-enters the equinoctial point? or if he knows not (if he ſhould) that it will not grow again? or whether he uſe to ſow Peaſe in the increaſe of <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>? or if ſo, whether they will then ever leave blooming or bloſſoming? or whether therefore he doth not obſerve and remember to ſet them in the wain, or decreaſe of <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>. Nay, it is reported of the women in the North, both of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> that they diligently obſerve a time of the Moon to ſet their Egges, that they may all come to good; and furthermore, let me ask the Husband-man, whether he obſerveth not a time to graff, and prune his Trees? but this is ſo common, that to ſpend more time hereunto were to no purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, for rendring a reaſon for Climacterical years, it happening by the profection of the Planets and Horo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope, aſcendant or firſt Houſe (as ye may call it) to the ☍ or <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> aſpects or their places in Nativities, or by the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ♄ if he have power in the Nativity, for <hi>Ptolomy</hi> and the wiſeſt in this Art, give ♄ as much power in the decree of ſeverall years, as the Sun hath in moneths, or the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> in dayes; and if his courſe be obſerved, it will be found finiſhed much about the ſame number of years, as the Moons is in dayes; and further, that ♄ in every ſeven years comes either to <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> or ☍ of his place in the <hi>Radix</hi> of Nativities. And further know, that if there be no danger (as we finde by experience) of ſome mens lives, at theſe years, they have either ſome of the beneficial Planets in their eighth Houſe, or the direction of the aſcendant, or Aphetical places are free from all impediment and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, of the interficient and malignant Conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, and laſtly, for Military Diſcipline, Hiſtory
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:121621:28"/>is full of Examples herein, and for brevities ſake (becauſe I will haſten to conclude this firſt Chapter, that I may proceed to M. <hi>Homes</hi> his ſecond Section) I will here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my ſelf with this one, which the Indian Hiſtories ſhew forth unto us; which is, that <hi>Columbus</hi> having the Art of Aſtrology, and being in a ſtraight for want of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, together with the whole Army of the King of <hi>Spain, Ferdinand;</hi> and foreſeeing an Eclipſe of the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> within few dayes to happen; threatned the Indians he would ſend infinite Plagues amongſt them, if they ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relieved them not; in token whereof they ſhould at ſuch a time ſee the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> light taken from them, which they at firſt ſlighted, but when they ſaw according to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer words, that the Moon began to be darkned and grew ſo more and more, and being ignorant of the cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, did not onely ſend them the Victual they formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from them, but alſo threw themſelves at <hi>Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> feet, asking forgiveneſs: So then ye have had (as brief as may be) ſhewn unto you, <hi>what Astrology is, that it is an Art, and a lawfull Art, allowed of by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, the antiquity of it, and the utility of it;</hi> there is it may be ſome Arts, that may be beneficial or helpfull to another; but you ſee both poſitively and concluſively, that Aſtrology is generally helpfull to all Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; nay, what other Study in the whole World in this point is like it, or able to compare with it?</p>
                  <p>SURVEY. <hi>Will. Ramſey</hi> in his Title might well have excepted <hi>Divinity</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> (if he hath any) and have diſtinguiſhed of <hi>Astrology.</hi> For ſure the Art pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to tell that the <hi>Thieves that committed the Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery about</hi> Brainsford <hi>the last Summer, that ſuch a way the womans Cows were gone.

Ramſey's</hi> manners that <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> is profitable for <hi>Morality</hi> (unleſs <hi>VVilliam</hi> will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny he hath any Aſtrology.) And therefore nor our <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,</hi> nor <hi>Aristotle</hi> the Prince of them mixed any directions out of Aſtrology, in their Moral Philoſophy. As for the <hi>diſpoſition of the minde VVilliam</hi> aſſured us in his Epiſtle to the Reader. That the will of man is not ſubject to the influence of the Starrs. And learned <hi>Huet</hi> in his <hi>EXAM. INGEN.</hi> tells us a readier way then by Starrs. And of the body, we know the temper, farr better by experience of the effect, then by conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals from cauſes, if Starrs were any certain cauſe. But <hi>VVill.

                  </p>
                  <p>As for the predicting <hi>what hope a man may have, by his own industry, or otherways to get goods,</hi> it doth little tend to Moral Philoſophy, and doth leſs appertain to Aſtrology, if <hi>VVilliam</hi> be an honeſt man of his word, in his particulars he layes down in his Epiſtle to the Reader before enumerated of <hi>Natural Philoſophy,</hi> I have ſeveral times ſhewed <hi>VVilliam,</hi> that the <hi>thing</hi> of natural Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy is a <hi>part; judicial,</hi> non-ens, or worſe.</p>
                  <p>And without either, thouſands of people that are no Aſtrologers, or Philoſophers excellently well know God to be the Creator and upholder of all things; whiles Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers and Aſtrologers have turned Atheiſts, or worſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>To ſay, <hi>the Starrs alot every mans prefixed time of life,</hi> is to intrench upon Gods <hi>Decree</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> and to avouch a <hi>fatal neceſſity</hi> in the influence of the Starrs; with which <hi>VVilliam</hi> promiſed us in his Epiſtle to the Reader his <hi>Astrology</hi> ſhould not meddle.</p>

                  <p>HE then brings Doctour <hi>Willet</hi> in theſe words, <hi>All manner of conjecturing (which ſaith he is meant by Aſtrology) is not unlawfull, whereof any Natural or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine cauſe can be yielded; as first there be Natural Signes in the Heavens and Air, as of the alteration of weather, of windes, of rain, &amp;c.</hi> This doth no whit hurt Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy; mark but the words, <hi>all manner of conjecturing is not unlawfull, &amp;c.</hi> and ſaith M. <hi>Homes, ſee he calleth it</hi> (meaning Aſtrology) <hi>but conjecturing onely;</hi> but doth M. <hi>Homes</hi> conjecture it to be no other? if he do, it is his ignorance. But let me not forget my ſelf, and ſpend too much time about him. It hath been already ſhewn, that the Starrs have the applauſe of power on the natural things of this world, as alſo the great <hi>Ptolomy</hi> (whoſe word in this caſe I believe will be taken before Doctour <hi>Willets</hi> or M. <hi>Homes</hi> his) gives his word for it; beſides experience alſo as above ſhewed; (and you know <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rientia docet:</hi>) there is no more to be ſaid, but that Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy is not (as Doctour <hi>Willet</hi> ſaith) unlawfnll; neither doth he in any wiſe condemn it, for in his following words he tells us, <hi>There are natural Signes in the Heavens and Air, which cauſe rain, winde, &amp;c.</hi> The cauſe of which, is no other then the influence of the Starrs, which if he deny, all Writers on this Art are contracted, as alſo the Scripture to boot; if then this be not a ſtrong Argument, let himſelf judge.</p>
                  <p>But to clear this point more fully: What, ſaith Maſter <hi>Homes,</hi> is the cauſe of Rain, alteration of Air, and the like? If his Maſter, Doctour <hi>Willet,</hi> did not theſe words ſhew it. me thinks he ſhould not have left the Reader unſatisfied; and not onely ſo, but have proved the Starrs to have no influence thereon, nor to be cauſes
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:121621:31"/>of theſe alterations, and then his argument had been good. But they are cauſes; And firſt let me give you <hi>Moſes</hi> judgement herein, who plainly tells us, <hi>The Stars are for ſigns and ſeaſons, Gen.</hi> 1.14. which M. <hi>Homes</hi> will ſay is fulfilled in the words following, <hi>viz. And God made two great lights, the one to rule the day, the other to rule the night, Gen.</hi> 1.16. To which then I anſwer, by way of Quere, to what end then are theſe invincible, irreſiſtable and innumerable hoſts of Heaven? were they made for no other uſe then to gaze on? the Sun and Moon will ſufficiently ſerve our turn for matter of light, if we look no further into their uſes; but the Scripture further putteth this matter quite out of doubt if we will believe Gods own word, <hi>Job</hi> 28.31. For he ſpeaking of his Omnipotent power, asketh his ſervant <hi>Job,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he, or any one elſe <hi>Can reſtrain the influence of the Pleiades, or looſe the bands of Orion:</hi> On which words <hi>S.

                  <p>SEeing then it is moſt clearly ſo, that the Stars are ſignes and cauſes as aboveſaid, what need theſe envious car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers or malicious gainſayers of the truth be heeded or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded? but let theſe perverſe rags of paper periſh with themſelves, not worthy the leaſt remembrance.

                  <p>But this is not all, he comes next to condemn Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy by <hi>Keckerman,</hi> and that with as weak <hi>Arguments</hi> as he did the reſt: <hi>Keckerman,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a moſt learned Philoſopher, and Chriſtian, although he favours ſome things which men now a dayes call part of Astrology, did not in all his two great Volumes in fol. of Arts and Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Jet forth any Astrology.</hi> A wiſe ſtory indeed; becauſe <hi>Keckerman</hi> writeth not of <hi>Astrology,</hi> therefore there is no ſuch thing: but if <hi>Keckerman</hi> hath not, yet as wiſe and as learned, and greater Philoſophers have, as if the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:121621:33"/>being of Aſtrology depended on his writing hereof,<note place="margin">Look the ſecond Chapter of this Treatiſe.</note> or it were a whit farther from being an heavenly Science and a lawfull Art, becauſe he omitteth it: fine Logick and rare reaſon, if rightly underſtood, and the depth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of throughly ſearched! becauſe <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> knew not the reaſon of the ebbing and flowing of the Sea, therefore no body elſe doth, neither is there ſuch a thing in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> writeth not of the Creation of Angels; <hi>Ergo,</hi> there is none: O profound and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible reaſon! But to proceed, (he ſaith) he is ſure he hath theſe words againſt it, <hi>Manent tamen, &amp;c. The Starrs abide, as of other ſublunary effects, ſo of effects in man, the common and remote cauſe, which many wayes may be hindred, not onely by the firſt cauſe, God, but alſo by particular cauſes, partly in the Heavens, partly in the Air and other Elements; ſo that the Predictions of Aſtrologers are with ifs and ands, &amp;c.</hi> which is as much to the purpoſe as comes juſt to nothing; for firſt, that God can alter the courſe of the Starrs, there is no Aſtrologer but will confeſſe (but whether he will or no, or ordinarily uſes ſo to do, is the queſtion) ſo that Maſter <hi>Homes</hi> gets little by this querk, ſince he affirmeth nothing that any Aſtrologer will deny. But if Maſter <hi>Keckerman</hi> maketh it not appear what particular cauſes hinder the effects of the Stars, me thinks for the ſtrength of his argument Maſter <hi>Homes</hi> ſhould have done it; for it ſtandeth not with any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that ſubordinate cauſes as are the Air and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Elements, ſhould predominate or rule over the firſt moving Cauſes, <hi>viz.</hi> the Starrs; this the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt capacity that underſtands the Art will affirm, and you have but now heard that the effects of the Starrs cauſe alteration and mutation of the Air, as we alſo daily ſee by experience; and therefore his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, that the Principles of Aſtrology are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed on true Principles, is here alſo condemned
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:121621:33"/>as erronious, falſe and malicious; for we ſee Aſtrologers ſeldome fail in their judgements, except when they ſwerve from the rules of Art: wherefore <hi>Alſteds</hi> aſſertion alſo is here no leſſe ſimple then the reſt, who ſaith, <hi>Aſtrologers are alſo often deceived;</hi> and what then? becauſe a man that never was at <hi>London,</hi> miſſeth his way, once or twice, ſhall he conclude there is no ſuch place? ſure it ſhould rather teach him to obſerve diligently his roade, and not turn on the right hand nor the left; and if the Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers would as warily obſerve their rules, this objection of the ignorant had never been thought on. But Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Homes,</hi> is Divinity falſe and no wiſe to be heeded, becauſe there is ſo many errours and ſchiſms crept into the Church? or becauſe every one attaineth not to a full perfection of the Spirit? or becauſe <hi>humanum eſt errare,</hi> man is frail and ſubject to failings? no ſure, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, reaſon and truth teacheth us to the contrary. Wherefore he might very well have omitted theſe ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der reaſons, as alſo that place of <hi>Galen,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>ſophiſticum eſt, it is ſophiſticall:</hi> but how? not as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no verity therein, but in the ſuperſtitious abuſe thereof, for you ſee clearly in the <hi>firſt Chapter of his Treatiſe,</hi> Galen <hi>holdeth that man a fool, rather then a Phyſician, that is not an Aſtrologer:</hi> and in all his works hath Aſtrology in great eſteem and applauſe, and moreover teſtifieth his own practice hereof, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de diebus decret. cap.</hi> 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. and the like. So he brings Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> to condemn it thus in theſe words, in his Treatiſe <hi>De Doctrina Chriſtiana, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 21, 22. <hi>eſt magnus error, magna dementia, et ſuperſtitio: Astrology is a great errour, madneſſe, and ſuperstition;</hi> it is clear that Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> here ſpeaketh of the ſuperſtitious uſe thereof, as in attributing fatall neceſſity thereto, and in too much truſting and confiding therein, as may appear by what you have already heard <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> ſaith of it; but to clear
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:121621:34"/>it more fully,<note place="margin">L. 5. c. 4. &amp; 1.20. c. 6. contra Fauſtum Manich.</note> S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> confeſſeth that before his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, he followed the hereſies of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> who maintained the ſtars to be adored and prayed unto, and therefore to reclaim the multitude, which went thus a whoring after the wayes of the Heathen, this good man uſeth theſe words to recall them, and unite them to the belief of God: But I hope M. <hi>Homes</hi> will not ſay that Aſtrologers are thus ſuperſtitious and wicked; he that ſaith Aſtrology (as I ſaid before) is any other thing then what is delivered by <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> in the ſecond page of this Treatiſe, knoweth not what Aſtrology is; Neither will he affirm I hope, that S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> condemns <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> but the ſuperſtitious abuſe thereof which is clear, for he delivereth five opinions concerning deſtiny.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that by deſtiny is underſtood <hi>the providence, will and power of God,</hi> and therefore he warneth the Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, that they continue their opinions, but correct their tongues,<note place="margin">1.5. c. 1. De Civ. Pei.</note> for through cuſtome of ſpeech the vulgar com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly underſtood nothing by the word <hi>fate</hi> or <hi>deſtiny,</hi> but the inevitable power of the Stars.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is quite contrary to the former, <hi>aſcribing all to the abſolute power of the Stars, without the will of God:</hi> But this opinion derogating from the omnipotent power of God, and his providence in all our actions, he ſaith ought to be rejected, not onely by thoſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the true Religion, but which ſerve or worſhip any gods at all, though never ſo falſe.</p>
                  <p>The third <hi>ſo attributeth to the decrees of the Stars, that yet they believe them to have this power in ſuch ſort derived unto them from God, that thereby they can, and do determine of us and our actions as they will themſelves:</hi> which opinion he thinketh is very wrongfully held of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to maintain ſuch wickedneſſe to be, as it were, inact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that moſt ſhining Senate, that were the like acted in any Court or State on earth, it were worthy to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:121621:34"/>
                  <p>The fourth opinion is, <hi>That the Stars have neither power nor will to operate on us at their own pleaſures, but as they do neceſſarily execute that which God impoſeth upon them;</hi> which Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> accounteth more into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable then the other, for that it teacheth us to conceive that of God, which they hold unworthy to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute unto the Starrs, againſt ſuch he ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth.</p>
                  <p>Theſe opinions, Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> renounceth, as they rather utterly deny the power and providence of God; or, as they impute abſolute rule and dominion of the Stars immediately over the will of man neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily inforcing us in all our actions; or as they throw all our ſinnes upon God, whileſt they make him by the Stars inevitably to inforce us to evil: wherefore had Maſter <hi>Homes</hi> (as it had befit a learned man) firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined his Authours with good obſervation and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and not ſo readily taken hold on every thing he finds delivered by others, that he imagineth will ſerve for his turn; I'm confident, he had not thus inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately alledged Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> againſt <hi>Aſtrologers,</hi> for (as I defined before in the ſecond page, what <hi>Aſtrology</hi> is, ſo the ſame) <hi>Ptolomy</hi> confeſſeth <hi>the Stars not to have any fatality, as working by or with a fatall neceſſity on the will or ſoul of man as much as S. Auſtine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> giving them no farther operation in theſe matters, then the moſt Orthodox and Learned Divines do.</p>
                  <p>The fifth opinion is, <hi>Which neither eſteemeth the Stars of their own wils, (as if they were living ſouls) to decree future events, nor neceſſarily to uſurp power over minds, but onely to ſignifie the inclinations of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and of all things compounded of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> meant not ſuch Aſtrologers as deny <hi>neceſſity</hi> (as Maſter <hi>Homes</hi> would fain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade the vulgar to believe;) but onely aſcribe power unto the Starrs to work upon ſublunary bodies; is
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:121621:35"/>evident by his words, <hi>Non uſque quaque abſurdè dici poſſit, adſolas corporum differentias, afflatus quoſdam valere ſidereos, ſicut in ſolaribus acceſsibus, &amp; receſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibus; videmus etiam ipſius anni tempora variari &amp; luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus incrementis, et decrementis augeri et minui quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam genera rerum; ſicut Echinos, et conchas, et mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles aeſtus oceani, non autem, et animi voluntates poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onibus ſiderum ſubdi:</hi> where we ſee nothing exempted from ſubjection to the Stars that is bodily, but onely our <hi>ſpirituall part.</hi> And he aſcribeth not this power to the Stars in generall, as that their ſpecificall virtues are not poſſible to be known to man, for he concurreth with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologers, that the quality of ♄ is cold, &amp;c, as you may further ſee at the beginning of this Chapter. So that you may ſee how falſly and injuriouſly he brings in Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> againſt <hi>Aſtrology.</hi>

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:121621:36"/>is briefly thus much, <hi>That after an earneſt deſire to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the perfection thereof, he ſeriouſly applyed himſelf unto the ſtudy, but in concluſion, when he thought to have had joy of his wearied labours, he was ſatisfied with nothing but uncertainty, and meeting an other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologer, told him how he had been deceived in the rules of the Art, who (for his comfort) concluded alſo as he did, that there was no certaincy therein, upon which he left off further ſtudying thereof.</hi> Now I would very fain know of any man (which ſhall be all the anſwer I ſhall give to this ſophiſticall cavill) whether by theſe words Aſtrology be convinced as uncertain, becauſe Maſter <hi>Briggs</hi> and another, (or ſuppoſe half a dozen more) could find no certainty therein; when <hi>Ptolomy, Galen, Hippocrates,</hi> Saint <hi>Auſtine,</hi> and thouſands more, found not onely certainty therein, but concluded and agreed that it was the moſt beneficiall and pleaſant Art under the Sun: and whereas he cites <hi>Phavorinus</hi> againſt Aſtrology in theſe words, <hi>Aut adverſa eventura dicunt, &amp;c.</hi> which is, <hi>They foretell either things of proſperity or adverſity; if of proſperity, and they fail, then thouſhalt be proſperous or happy in hoping for that good, if of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, and hit not right, then thou wert miſerable in fearing in vain; &amp;c.</hi> which agrees with what he ſaith M. <hi>Briggs</hi> would undertake to do, <hi>viz. To prove the rules of Aſtrology contradictory, viz.</hi> It ſhall be ſo, and it ſhall not be ſo, which is the meereſt cavill of all the reſt, to ſay, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Aſtrology is uncertain. I will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake then a greater matter then M. <hi>Briggs,</hi> for let there be what Art or Science that M. <hi>Homes</hi> can deviſe nominated (though never ſo true) I will undertake to ſpeak as much, nay and with more proof againſt it, then all theſe his learned men hath done in this <hi>his character of the preſent times;</hi> (he forgot to put in thoſe that deny the truth; nay, and not onely ſo, but ſophiſtically and maliciouſly maintain it to their utmoſt indeavours, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:121621:36"/>the citing of S. <hi>Auſtine</hi> to be proof enough to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the Reader from undertaking this ſtudy, or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing therein, not obſerving the words of his Authour, and together with the <hi>Fathers</hi> to include the <hi>Councils;</hi> but tels us not how and upon what grounds and reaſons they diſallowed of the Art, leſt then his malice be diſcovered.) Wherefore let me then for a concluſion, as well to this Chapter, as his cavils, ask him theſe two queſtions; whether a man may not (if enviouſly diſpoſed) ſpeak againſt the moſt manifeſt truths, nay againſt the very word of God, and wreſt the Scripture to their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and intentions? And ſecondly, if he be proved hereof guilty, in the next Chapter, to wreſt the Scripture ſenſe to confute Aſtrology; whether he be not more fit to be brought under the laſh of the Law, then Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers? So have you <hi>his learned men</hi> againſt Aſtrology confuted; we come now to the main point of all, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether Aſtrology be condemned by the word of God?</p>
                  <p>SURVEY. Thus with large patience have we gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven long leave to <hi>Will. Ramſey</hi> to ſpeak thus much together, without interruption; ſaving onely, that in his meer impertinencies, and ſome unmannerly jeerings and railings, theſe <hi>Sections</hi> of his are made by the Re-Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in part to keep ſilence. But to the matter. What a huge company of <hi>Levers</hi> in one place doth he bring to break an <hi>Egg!</hi> What a many of <hi>Candles</hi> doth he light up, in another place, to ſhew us that the <hi>Sun ſhines;</hi> which we ſaw and acknowledged afore he lighted them up! He hath ſhot a great many ſharp words, and with much virulency; but at Rovers, ſo that he doth not onely miſſe the mark, but alſo not hit the Butt. Did the <hi>Doctour</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in the leaſt his Quotation of Authours that have been againſt <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> in a way of <hi>argument</hi> or <hi>proof?</hi> His words in the very beginning of his ſecond Section (which <hi>Will. Ramſey</hi> hath all this while ſo puddered
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:121621:37"/>himſelf to confute) ſhew <hi>William</hi> the contrary, if he had been willing to ſee. <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith the Doctour) <hi>the Astrologers give out, that there is no body againſt this Astrology but one</hi> Perkins, <hi>or ſome one or two more, men not acquainted with Art; or in the like ſlighting ſpeeches; it will be very convenient to quicken your atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as to a point conſiderable, by ſetting before you the judgement of ſeverall learned men touching Aſtrology.</hi> Indeed if I do here but reprint that ſecond Section of the Doctour, which <hi>Will.</hi> pretends to confute, it will be a ſufficient confutation of all theſe five Sections of <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>'s ſecond Chapter.</p>

                     <hi>Willet</hi> on the ſame Chapter, in his 32. <hi>Qu.</hi> hath this diſcourſe: <q>All manner of CONJECTURING (ſee he cals it but <hi>Conjecturing</hi>) is not unlawful, whereof any <hi>naturall</hi> or <hi>divine Cauſe</hi> can be <hi>yielded:</hi> As firſt, there are naturall ſignes in the Heavens and air, as of the alteration of weather, of winds, of rain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in compound bodies, as in ſetting, and planting of Trees; and in humane bodies, as when tis good to let blood, to purge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe are <hi>immediate</hi> effects in nature of Celeſtiall bodies: There are alſo <hi>mediate</hi> effects, as Comets which ſhew ſiccity and combuſtions, and ſo many portend Wars, which is cauſed by wrath among men, which cometh of ſiccity and heat: So the Crow cryes againſt rain, becauſe the moiſture of the air affects his feathers: And the Dolphin againſt a tempeſt ſwims aloft, becauſe the Sand in the bottome is ſtirred. For theſe creatures that are led onely by ſenſe, have a quicker feeling of ſuch naturall accidents, then man hath, who is moſt occupied in the uſe and exerciſe of reaſon: For, <hi>Attentio ad operationes ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundùm rationem, &amp;c,</hi> that is, <hi>The attending upon the operations of reaſon, doth take away the attention to the operation of nature:</hi> And therefore FOOLS and SIM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLE perſons, that are LEAST GUIDED by reaſon, are more ſenſible of naturall things then WISE men.</q>

                  </p>
                  <p>Doctour <hi>Willet</hi> adds on the ſame Chapter, <hi>Qu.</hi> 33. (to give it you in a word) thus; <q>Signs obſerved by men, of humane events, cannot be ſigns; firſt, becauſe <hi>Ex varietate cauſae variatur cauſatum:</hi> The Stars have not the ſame influence in Summer, and in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Spring, and Autumn. Secondly, <hi>Ex unitate cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſae

Thirdly, <hi>Keckerman</hi> a moſt learned Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, and a Chriſtian, although he favours ſome things, which men now a dayes call part of Aſtrology, did not in all his two great Volumes of Arts and Sciences in <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio,</hi> ſet forth any <hi>Aſtrology;</hi> but in his Works hath theſe paſſages againſt it, to this effect: <q>
                        <hi>Manent tamen &amp;c.</hi> The Stars abide, as of other ſublunary effects, ſo of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in man, the COMMON and REMOTE <hi>Cauſes</hi> which many wayes may be hindred, not onely by the firſt cauſe, GOD, but alſo by particular cauſes, partly in the HEAVENS, partly in the AIR, and other ELE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENTS; ſo that the PREDICTIONS OF ASTROLOGIE, are with IFFS and ANDS. So that it follows not, this man is born under an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Star, therefore he hath a dull wit.</q> So <hi>Kecker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, System. Phyſ. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>De Motu Cocli.</hi> The ſame <hi>Keckerman</hi> in another place hath theſe words. <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciplina Aſtrologica, &amp;c.</hi> 
                     <q>The Diſcipline of Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie about the Predictions by Heavenly bodies, or Stars, <hi>is not yet confirmed upon true principles;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no marvell if that part of Aſtrology, which is converſant about the predictions of Comets, <hi>doth reſt upon moſt uncertain principles.</hi> It is granted to <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy</hi> to uſe ſuch Hypotheſes, or arguments, or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which are not in nature, but are conceived onely by a kind of ſimilitude: But <hi>Aſtrology</hi> may not uſe ſuch Hypotheſes. The Aſtrologers aſſign ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and Cities, to ſeverall Celeſtiall Signs; <hi>But of Cities plainly, no reaſon at all appears.</hi>
                     </q> So Keckerman Syſt. Phyſ. lib. 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>De Cometis in genere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Alſted</hi> the great Philoſopher of theſe times, and a Chriſtian, ſets forth a thing he calls Aſtrology; but ſee his faithfulneſſe in this; <hi>Aſtrologia</hi> (ſaith he)
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:121621:38"/>
                     <hi>vitio,</hi> &amp;c. Aſtrology by the vice of man <hi>hath more vanity in it then Aſtronomy.</hi> Aſtrology becauſe of our <hi>imbecility is conjecturall.</hi> And he adds. <hi>Aſtrologers are often deceived.:</hi> and therefore we do rightly (ſaith he) pronounce the <hi>divinatory part of Aſtrology</hi> to be but <hi>Conjecturall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The great <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith of Aſtrology, <hi>Sophiſticum eſt, &amp;c.</hi> Tis a ſophiſticall thing; <hi>Contrary to experience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, So famous a man as was S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> famous for learning and godlineſſe in his time, having been addicted to <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> afterwards repents of it, and renounceth it, in his Treatiſe, <hi>De doctr. Chriſtiana, lib</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. <hi>in fine, &amp; initio capitis</hi> 22. His words are theſe.

                  </p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> brings in another, on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. as <hi>a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent renouncing this Art, Paganiſme and Judaiſme:</hi> For we know that the Scriptures do much forbid it to the <hi>Jews,</hi> as the evill of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> as we ſhall ſee plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Maſter <hi>Perkins,</hi> famous for learning and godlineſſe, as his Works ſhew, hath not only a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe againſt Aſtrology (though once much addicted to it) but alſo gives us his <hi>repentance and renouncing of it</hi> in his <hi>Preface</hi> to the Reader before his <hi>reſolution to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-man.</hi> His words are theſe: <q>I have long ſtudied this Art, and was never quiet till I had ſeen all the ſecrets of it, but at length it pleaſed God to lay before me the PROPHANENESSE of it; nay I dare boldly ſay, the IDOLATRY, although it be covered with fair and golden ſhews: Therefore that which I ſpeak with grief, I deſire thee to note with ſome attention <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Eighthly, Maſter <hi>Geree,</hi> known to me to be a godly and learned man (being Collegians in the Univerſity) hath a learned Treatiſe againſt Aſtrology (which if men read
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:121621:39"/>well, they dare not, if they have any truth of grace, give themſelves to Aſtrology) His Treatiſe is called <hi>Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia-Maſtix</hi> common to be had for a ſmall matter.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, Maſter <hi>Geree</hi> avoucheth Maſter <hi>Brigs</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Geometry</hi> Reader at <hi>Oxford</hi> an eminent godly man (a man I my ſelf knew well, and have been at his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures) and a man for his skill in <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> I think I may ſay (ſaith Maſter <hi>Geree</hi>) that he was ſecond to none. Of this Maſter <hi>Brigs,</hi> Maſter <hi>Geree</hi> gives us this account: This loving Friend of mine (ſaith Maſter <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ree</hi>) upon a queſtion moved to him by me, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Judiciall Astrology,</hi> told me this remarkable Story of himſelf; When he came to <hi>Cambridge</hi> firſt, he thought it a fine thing to be of <hi>Gods Counſell,</hi> to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know ſecrets, and reſolved to have that knowledge, what labour ſoever it coſt him; and ſo early applyed himſelf to the ſtudy of the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> beginning with <hi>Arithmetick</hi> and ſo to <hi>Geometry,</hi> and <hi>Aſtronomy;</hi> and to lay a good foundation he left none of theſe Arts, till he had attained exactneſſe in them: The foundation thus layd, he then applyed himſelf to his main ſcope, the ſearch of <hi>Judiciall Aſtrology;</hi> but there he found his expectation fruſtrate; THERE WAS NO CERTAIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY in the rules thereof. When he had tyred his body and wits in vain, he was much dejected with the fruſtrating of his expectation: At laſt he repaired to a man in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> famous in that Art, and a <hi>practitioner in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoſtications by it:</hi> to him he made his moan what pains he had taken to be expert in <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> and how the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of the rules of that Art did now defeat his hopes: The <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> reply was, that THE RULES OF THAT ART WERE UNCERTAIN INDEED, NEI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER WAS THERE ANY CURE FOR IT: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Maſter <hi>Brigs</hi> relinquiſht that ſtudy. And he did then affirm to me, that <hi>he would undertake to the skilfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Aſtrologer in the VVorld, that let him ſet down any
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:121621:39"/>concluſion touching any man or State, yea or</hi> WEATHER, <hi>and he would prove it</hi> CONTRADICTORILY; that is, <hi>Both that it would fall out ſo, and that it would not fall out ſo, from their own Rules and Principles;</hi> whence (ſaith he) you may ſee apparently that there can be no <hi>certainty</hi> in the rules of that Art. He further added, that his opinion was; <hi>To thoſe that addicted themſelves to the practiſes of Divining Aſtrology, the Devill did at firſt ſecretly lend his aſſiſtance;</hi> and at length, <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datim</hi> (that is gradually) <hi>did</hi> (unleſſe God prevented) <hi>entice them into contract.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tenthly, <hi>Dominicus Nanus, Barthol. Amantius, Franciſc. Tortius, Joſeph Langius;</hi> have gathered theſe collections touching Aſtrology: <hi>Aſtrologia,</hi> &amp;c. Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy is the <hi>Speech of Stars</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,) But <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy</hi> is (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,) the <hi>Law</hi> of the Stars; as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing more certainty to Aſtronomy then to Aſtrology. This Aſtrology is ſaid to be invented by <hi>Atlanta,</hi> King of <hi>Mauritanie,</hi> witneſſe <hi>Pliny, l.</hi> 7. <hi>of his Naturall Hiſtory;</hi> which if true, is no commendation of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy. <hi>Contemplantur Aſtronomi,</hi> &amp;c. that the Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers contemplate the Stars, not as <hi>Judiciary Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> and Chaldeans, condemned by the Prophers, but that by the ſituation of them, they may ſet forth the ſet, or ſtanding times of dayes, moneths, and years; the Edipſes of the Sun and Moon and other things moſt worthy to be known, and moſt profitable for the life of man. The vanity of Judiciary Aſtrology, innumerable wife men of Old. and in our Age have diſallowed. See what God pronounceth of Aſtrologers by <hi>Moſes Deut.</hi> 18.10. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. <hi>Phavorinus</hi> in <hi>A. Gell. lib.</hi> 14. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. was wont to reprove <hi>Judiciary Aſtrologers</hi> with this Dilemma; <hi>Aut adverſa eventura dicunt.</hi> &amp;c. that is, Either they foretell that things of <hi>adverſity</hi> ſhall come to paſſe; or thoſe of <hi>proſperity:</hi> If they ſay pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous things, and do fruſtrate or deceive men, then
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:121621:40"/>
                     <hi>thou ſhalt be miſerable in hoping in vain:</hi> If they ſay things of adverſity and do lye; then thou ſhalt be miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in fearing in vain and without cauſe. If <hi>true</hi> things anſwer to their Predictions, but are not proſperous things, from thence forward thou art miſerable in thy <hi>mind</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou art ſo in the <hi>event.</hi> If they promiſe <hi>happy things,</hi> and they come to paſſe, then plainly two inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies will attend; namely, both the expectation of them in ſuſpence of hope will weary thee; and the hope thou hadſt, will now deflowre, or take away the grace and beauty of the future fruit of joy. <hi>Therefore by no means may we uſe thoſe kind of men who preſage future things.

                  <p>Not to ſtay upon that moſt <hi>improper ſpeech of Will.</hi> in his ſecond Chapter, to charge the <hi>Doctour</hi> with <hi>malice</hi> againſt <hi>things;</hi> as with <hi>malice</hi> againſt <hi>Aſtrology</hi> (Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice is of a perſon againſt a <hi>perſon</hi>); let the Reader one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly note there, with a glance, how profeſſedly <hi>Will.</hi> doth ſlight Learned men, if they do not ſpeak ſo as having truch and reaſon on their ſide; <hi>Will. Ramſey being J<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>DGE.</hi> For that's the <hi>Genuine</hi> reſult of his ſpeech. And by conſequence, if all the Learned men in the world beſide Aſtrologers, ſhould condemn Aſtrology, <hi>Will.</hi> would ſlight them (as he doth in his Book) becauſe he judgeth them not to ſpeak according to truth and reaſon.</p>
                  <p>To <hi>W.

But are <hi>his liberty of expatiating, upon unlawfull Arts in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; and therein to declare his judgement concerning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull predictions. Toſtatus</hi> and Doctour <hi>Willet</hi> had more wit then to take a text of <hi>Familiar Spirits,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute <hi>Aſtrology.</hi> Though ſome <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> are not free from <hi>Familiarity</hi> with ſuch. And <hi>B. C.</hi> proves an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite complyance. Thus much onely hath given ſuch a blow to <hi>Will. Ramſeys</hi> firſt Section, that the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of it falls to the ground in the eyes of them that will underſtand.</p>
                  <p>To his ſecond Section; and firſt to that <hi>Will.</hi> ſaith and ſo labours to prove that <hi>Stars</hi> are <hi>Cauſes;</hi> the <hi>Doctour</hi> denies it not, though that man of vaſt learning <hi>Marſ.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:121621:41"/>Ficinus</hi> a famous Platonick Philoſopher in his works hath a Tract againſt it. 2. To <hi>Williams</hi> catching at the word <hi>CONJECTV RING of and concerning things which are naturall cauſes, as of alteration of weather, &amp;c.</hi> experience daily and evidently doth tell all men that have eyes to read Almanacks, and to ſee the weather; that how naturall and neceſſary ſoever the <hi>cauſes</hi> may be, the <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> predictions of it are but conjecturing, and daily prove falſe. Yet neither Doctour <hi>Willet</hi> nor Doctour <hi>Homes</hi> do move the queſtion, touching the <hi>thing</hi> which (commonly) is called <hi>Naturall</hi> Aftrology. And therefore as they do not juſtifie <hi>Judiciall;</hi> ſo they do not condemn <hi>naturall.</hi> touching <hi>weather,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore <hi>Will.</hi> is at the <hi>Labour-in-vain;</hi> uttering no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt the <hi>Doctour</hi> for me to take cognizance of, till he mentions S. <hi>Austins referring us</hi> (as <hi>Will.</hi> ſaith) <hi>to the ſtudy of Astrology,</hi> in his Annotations on <hi>Job.</hi> chapter 38. v. 31.

                  <p>To <hi>VVill. R.</hi> third <hi>Section,</hi> being a great body with little ſoul in it (as was Doctour <hi>Ames</hi> his Character of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> works <hi>(Moles abſque nervis)</hi> I need not add much to the ſubſtance of what D. <hi>Homes</hi> hath ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

It was the fault of the <hi>Devil</hi> he quoted not the whole period of the Scripture he alleadged. And certainly the <hi>Astrologer</hi> is not blameleſſe in his curt quoting the <hi>Doctour,</hi> whoſe words you may ſee afore are, <hi>That Keckerman a moſt learned Philoſopher, and a Chriſtian, although he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours ſome things, which men now a dayes call Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, did not in all his two great volumes in folio of the Arts and Sciences, ſet forth any Aſtrology, BVT IN HIS VVORKS HATH THESE PASSAGES AGAINST IT,</hi> &amp;c. Now this laſt clauſe here in capitall letters are left out by <hi>VVilliam Ramſey</hi> to the immediate ruine of all he ſaith, till he come to <hi>MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NENT TAMEN</hi> a freſh matter. Yea if that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall clauſe had not been in, it had been good Logick and reaſon to ſay what the Doctour concludes; That <hi>Kec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerman</hi> handling of purpoſe of the main body of Arts and Sciences, and among them all, the reall <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> and leaving out Aſtrology, doth ſhew, that <hi>Kecker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> was rather againſt then for Aſtrology. Or that <hi>Kec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerman</hi> did think there was no ſuch lawfull Science.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:121621:42"/>Even as if <hi>Moſes</hi> of purpoſe had ſet himſelf to handle all Pneumatology, <hi>i.e. a Syſtem of Spirits and Souls,</hi> and handling of the Souls of Animals, and of the Souls or Spirits of men, and of the Holy ſpirit, had quite left out the doctrine of Angels, it would well have inferred there were no Angels. But the whole Bible is not a Syſtem, but a graduall diſcovery of truths, (according to the growth of the Church) with explications, and repetitions. And though <hi>Moſes</hi> included the creation of the <hi>Angels</hi> in the creation of the <hi>Heavens</hi> (as <hi>Will.</hi> Couſin-<hi>Philoſopher</hi> acutely well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves in his <hi>Enchiridion Phyſicae reſtitutae</hi>), but expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them not (that as Divines obſerve, the ſons of men might not dream the concurrence of Angels in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) till <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. and afterwards much, that was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to clear it; <hi>Moſes</hi> owned the being and Doctrine of Angels. But <hi>Keckerman</hi> from firſt to laſt doth not approve of the thing and doctrine of Judiciall Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. Now for <hi>VVil.</hi> anſwer to <hi>Keckerman</hi>'s <hi>MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NENT TAMEN</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i.e. The Stars abide,</hi> &amp;c. unto <hi>Cometis in genere,</hi> which you have here inſerted out of the <hi>Doctours Demologie</hi> word for word; let the underſtanding Reader judge, 1. Whether <hi>VVill. Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey</hi> hath confuted it! 2. Whether the Doctour by the rule of reaſon or Art was bound to argue out <hi>Kecker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> aſſertions; ſeeing he alledgeth him onely as a particular example of one learned man among others, that was againſt Aſtrology! 3. Whether <hi>VVill.</hi> doth not evidently contradict himſelf in ſaying, <hi>That the words of Keckerman are as much as comes to nothing;</hi> and yet preſently labours, <hi>but in vain,</hi> to confute them.

                     <q>That the predictions of Aſtrology are with Ifs and Ands; <hi>and that</hi> Aſtrology is not yet confirmed upon true Principles; <hi>and that</hi> Aſtrology converſant about Comets, doth reſt upon moſt uncertain Principles. <hi>And laſtly,</hi> That there is no reaſon appears why Aſtrologers ſhould aſſign ſeverall Cities to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Signs.</q> Of all which Concluſions aſſerted by <hi>Kec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerman, VVill.

But <hi>Ptolomy</hi> affirmes <hi>(ibid) an uncertainty in it by reaſon of the contrariety of cauſes.</hi> As for that <hi>Sophisticum</hi> of <hi>Galen,</hi> I ſaid afore it was quoted out of <hi>Alsted:</hi> and I do charge <hi>VVill. Ram.</hi> with a <hi>Sophiſticum</hi> out of <hi>Galen,</hi> That a man is rather a Fool than a Phyſician, that is not an <hi>Aſtrologer.</hi> For, firſt, experience teſtifies that there have been and are many famous ſucceſsfull Phyſicians that are nothing in Judicial Aſtrology. And ſecondly on the other ſide, though <hi>Will.</hi> pretend much skill in <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> yet is he not famous for <hi>Phyſick,</hi> or <hi>freedom from folly,</hi> as his Book (now under conſideration) doth amply teſtifie. Yea, the next paſſage of this Section teſtifies. For he never would have mentioned <hi>Auſtin</hi> at all; or that place of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> if he would not have the ſhame of Aſtrology ript up, and expoſed to open contempt. But ſeeing <hi>Will.</hi> is ſo imprudent, or impudent, or both, to pretend that <hi>Auſtin</hi> is a friend to Aſtrology; <hi>William</hi> ſhall now have his belly full of <hi>Auſtin</hi> afore we part. <hi>Auſtin's</hi> words at length, in his ſecond Book of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Doctrine, <hi>cap.</hi> 22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 23. are theſe; <q>

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:121621:43"/>ſyderum, &amp;c.</hi> that is, <hi>But to undertake to foretell the manners, acts, and events of men from their births, is a great Errour, and a great madneſs. And even with them that have learned theſe things (to be unlearned) i, without all doubt, this ſuperſtition confuted. For the Conſtellations, as they call them, is a not ation of Starrs, how they were, when he was born concerning whom thoſe miſerable wretches are conſulted, by them that are more miſerable. But it may be that ſome TVVINNES are ſo immediatly poured out of the womb, that no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall of time between them can be apprehended and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the numbers of Conſtellations. From whence it is of neceſſity that ſome TWINNES must have the ſelf ſame Conſtellations; when as of the things they do or ſuffer there are not the ſame events, but for the moſt part are ſo different, that the one lives moſt happily, the the other moſt unhappily; as we ſee in</hi> Jacob <hi>and</hi> Eſau. <hi>Neither doth it appertain to the matter, for them to ſay, that that ſame leaſt and narroweſt moment of time, which diſtinguiſheth the birth of Twins is of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence in the nature of things, and the rapacious ſwiftneſs of the Heavens. For though I ſhould grant, in many things that to be of conſequence, yet cannot the Mathematician finde among the Conſtellations by what obſervations or conſidertions of them he profeſſeth to foretel deſtinies. Therfore opinionatings, or conjecturings by certain ſignes of things taught by humane preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are to be referred to the ſame as certain COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PACTS AND AGREEMENTS WITH DEVILS. For hence it is, that men greedy of evil things, by a certain occult divine judgement are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up to be illuded and deceived according to the merits of their luſts, the deluding Angels coozening and deceiving them.</hi>

                  <p>Thus <hi>Austin</hi> in the place aforeſaid, gives Aſtrology a terrible Broad-ſide, how ever <hi>VVill. Ramſey</hi> would
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:121621:44"/>mince the matter. And how untruly he minceth it, let the upright Reader judge by comparing <hi>VVillams</hi> flaſh and gloſs, with the Text and words of <hi>Austin</hi> himſelf. From which <hi>William</hi> flies, and declines the giving of due ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to them, and moſt impudently and impertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tells us Stories of <hi>Austin</hi> againſt <hi>Faustus,</hi> and of <hi>Aug. de Givitate Dei.</hi> Juſt as if a man ſhould be called to anſwer at <hi>London</hi> upon an Action touching Cheeſe; but he runs to <hi>York,</hi> and pleads to the matter of Chalk: However we muſt follow the Offender, till he be ferreted out of all his hiding places, and taken. If it were as <hi>VVill. Ramſey</hi> reports of <hi>Auſtin</hi> againſt <hi>Fauſtus;</hi> yet <hi>Auſtin's</hi> judgement after his converſion is to be preferred afore his practiſe afore his converſion.

That A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrological predicting or foretelling of events from the Births of men is a great errour and madneſs?</hi> And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not now under conſideration, that <hi>Auſtin</hi> all along his Works was of the ſame minde, and that juſtly, againſt <hi>Judicial Aſtrology,</hi> 
                     <q>be it but as <hi>Ptolomy</hi> ſets it forth,</q> wherein he affirmes for it (which is bad enough and too bad)? And particularly for <hi>Auſtin</hi> againſt <hi>Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus, William R.</hi> doth <hi>moſt abominably abuſe him.</hi> For in his fifth Booth, <hi>cap.</hi> 4. or 20.

Ram.</hi> juggling, the ſhame of <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> and the glory of <hi>Truth. Will. Ram.</hi> quotation of that fifth Book of <hi>Aug. de Civitate Dei, cap.</hi> 1. ſhall be judge; and I will give
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:121621:44"/>it you according to the Engliſh Tranſlation of <hi>Aug. de Civitate Dei,</hi> (commonly to be had) that the Reader may ſee, if he pleaſe, whether I deal truly with him or no? To omit <hi>Auſtin's</hi> Preamble, he fals upon the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, word for word thus, <q>
                        <hi>The God of Heaven by his onely providence diſpoſeth of the Kingdoms of the earth, which if any man will ſay is ſwayed by fate, and mean by that fate,</hi> the will of God, <hi>he may</hi> hold his opinion ſtill, <hi>but yet</hi> he muſt a mend his ſpeech; <hi>for why did he not learn this of him that taught him, what fate was? The ordinary custome of this hath made men imagine fate to be A POVVER OF THE STARS ſo, or ſo placed,</hi> in Nativities, <hi>or</hi> conceptions; <hi>which ſome do ſeparate from the determination of God, and other ſome do affirm to depend wholly thereupon. But thoſe that hold that the Starrs do manage our actions, or our paſſions, good or ill without Gods appointment are to be ſilenced, and not to be heard, be they of the true Religion or be they bond ſlaves to idolatry, of what ſort ſoever; for what doth this opinion but flatly exclude all Deity? Againſt this opinion we profeſs not any diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but onely againſt thoſe that calumniate Christian Religion in defence of their imaginary gods. As for thoſe that make theſe operations of the ſtars in good or bad</hi> to depend upon Gods will, <hi>if they ſay they have this power given them from him to uſe according to</hi> their own wills, they do Heaven much wrong, in imagining that any wicked acts or in juries are decreed in ſo glorious a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and ſuch as if any earthly City had but inſtituted, the whole generation of man would have conſpired the ſubverſion of it. <hi>And what part hath God left him in this diſpoſing of humane affairs, if they be ſwayed by</hi> a neceſſicy from the Starrs, <hi>whereas he is the Lord of men and Starrs?</hi> If they <hi>do not ſay that the Starrs are cauſes of theſe wicked acts, through a power that God hath given them, but that they effect them by his</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:121621:45"/>command; is this fit to be imagined for true of God, that is unworthy to be held true of the Starrs? <hi>But if the Starrs be ſaid to</hi> po tend <hi>this onely,</hi> and not to procure it, <hi>and that their poſitions be but</hi> Signes <hi>not</hi> Cauſes <hi>of ſuch effects (for ſo hold many great Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, though the Aſtrologians uſe not to ſay</hi> Mars <hi>in ſuch a Houſe</hi> SIGNIFIETH this or that, no but MAKETH <hi>the childe born a</hi> Homicide, <hi>to grant them this</hi> Errour <hi>of ſpeech, (which they wuſt learn to</hi> reform <hi>of the Philoſophers in all their preſages,</hi> derived <hi>from the Stars poſitions: (how cometh it to paſs that they could never ſhew the reaſon of that diverſity of life, actions, fortune, profeſſion, art, honour, and ſuch</hi> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <hi>accidents, that hath befallen TVVINNES?

So that <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth not mention Aſtrologers, or if he meant them, yet doth he not ſay, they may hold their opinions (in the Plural Number) much leſs their Aſtrological opinions. Then <hi>Auſtin</hi> would be <hi>heautonti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moroumenos,</hi> a fighter againſt himſelf, a ſelf-vexer. But for all this, <hi>VVill. Ram.</hi> will not leave <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſo, nor will I the while leave him. For all that <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath ſaid <hi>de Civitate Dei, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. and his proſecuting his great argum ent from Twinnes, <hi>ibid. cap.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. and the head and ſumm of his fifth Chapter is, <hi>How the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians may be convicted of PROFESSING VANITR;</hi> and therefore farr from concurring with Aſtrologers, as <hi>Will. Ram.</hi> would make us believe in his marginal note; yet <hi>Will. Ram.</hi> hopes to collect out of <hi>Auſtin's</hi> ſixth Chapter of the ſame Book ſomething to favour Aſtrology, <hi>Non uſque quaque abſurdè dici poſſit,</hi> (ſaith <hi>William,</hi> picking a Daiſie here and there, and then ſtripping off the leaves of graſs about it, I mean his ill tranſlating) <hi>Where we ſee</hi> ſaith <hi>Will. Ram. nothing is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from ſubjection to the Starrs that is bodily, but onely our ſpiritual part, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo <hi>William</hi> goes on, concluding this his third Section with a mighty outcry againſt the <hi>Doctour,</hi> for (as <hi>William</hi> ſaith) his <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>injurious</hi> bringing of S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> againſt Aſtrology, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But Reader have patience ere thou judgeſt, till I have been at the pains to tranſcribe the whole ſixth Chapter of <hi>Aug. de Civitate Dei</hi> as near as I can to a ſillable, as 'tis in the common Engliſh Tranſlation for thy better aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Doctours truth, which is thus;</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>It often falleth out (<hi>ſaith</hi> Auſtin) notwithſtanding
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:121621:46"/>that in theſe concurrences, and unions of times, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and Conſtellation, the children conceived are the one a male, the other a female. I know two Twinnes of divers Sexes both of them alive, and Iuſty at this day. They are as like in favour one to another, as their difference of ſex can permit; but in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion and order of life, <hi>ſo unlike, that</hi> (beſides the actions which muſt of neceſſity diſtinguiſh between men and women) he is continually in warr, in the office of a <hi>Count,</hi> and never cometh home; ſhe continually in her Countrey, where ſhe was born, and never goeth abroad. Nay, which is more incredible, (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the powers of the Starrs, and not the wills of God and men) he is a married man, and ſhe is an holy virgin; he hath many children, and ſhe was never mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. <hi>O but their HOROSCOPES had a great ſway in all things.</hi> Tuſh, I have ſhewn the power of that to be juſt nothing already. I but what ſoever it doth it is there in the nativity that muſt do it. What and not in the conception, wherein it is manifeſt, that there is but one generative act concurrent? For natures power is ſuch, that a woman having once conceived cannot ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond any conception, untill ſhe be delivered of the firſt. And therefore it is neceſſary, that the Twinnes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception fall both in one moment. Were their divers HOROSCOPES (think you) the cauſe that in their birth, he became a man-childe, and ſhe a woman? Wherefore ſince it is no ſuch abſurdity to ſay, that there are ſome Planetary influences that have effect onely upon diverſity of formes in bodies, as we ſee the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the year by the Suns acceſs, and departure; and divers things to decreaſe and increaſe, juſt as the Moon doth (Crabs for example, and all ſhell-fiſhes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the wonderfull courſe of the Sea) but that the minde of man is not ſubject to any of theſe powers of the Starrs; thoſe Artiſts now deſiring to binde our
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:121621:46"/>acts unto this we ſee them free from, do ſhew us plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; that <hi>the effects of the Starrs have no power ſo much as upon our bodies.</hi> For what is ſo pertinent unto the body as the ſex thereof? And yet we ſee that two Twinnes of divers ſexes may be conceived both under one Conſteilation. Wherefore what FONDER AF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FECTION can there be, then to ſay, <hi>That that figure of Heaven which was one in the conception of them both, had not power to keep the ſiſter from differing in ſex from her brother, with whom ſhe had one Conſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> and yet that that fign of Heaven which ruled at their nativity had power to make her differ ſo farr from him in her virgins ſanctimony.</q> Thus <hi>Auſtin.</hi> And now for ſhame let <hi>Will.</hi> hold his outcries againſt Doctour <hi>Homes,</hi> for that the Doctour ſaid <hi>Auſtin was againſt Aſtrology.</hi> And for ſhame let <hi>William</hi> endeavour no more to gull his Reader with pretence that <hi>Auſtin</hi> is for Aſtrology.

               <p>BUt before I begin, I ſhall deſire the Reader to have a ſpecial care to remember what Aſtrology is, which is now in controverſie, and either to be confuted and condemned, or defended and cleared; the definition whereof you have at the beginning of the firſt Chapter, for otherwiſe our pains and arguments are but frivolous on either ſide; wherefore I commend M. <hi>Homes</hi> in that he did not firſt ſet down the ſtate of his queſtion, before he began to conſute it; but thinking <hi>pleno ore,</hi> to condemn
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:121621:48"/>Aſtrology, will be enough to ſcare the Reader from the ſtudy thereof, leaving him to conſider what it is he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns, although he be altogether ignorant of the ſame; and ſo his words may have the more force, and take the deeper impreſſion in the Readers heart to believe what he would fain, and as much as in himlies, ſtudies to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain.</p>
               <p>SURVEY. Before we hear <hi>Will. Ram.</hi> any further, ſomething muſt be ſaid to this general of his third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in two particulars. 1.

For as <hi>Ptolomy</hi> (whence <hi>Will. Ram.</hi> definition is pretended to be collected) confeſſeth (ibidem) <q>
                     <hi>Multi quaeſtus causâ, alias divinationes venditant nomine &amp; dignitate hujus Artis, ac vulgo imponunt multa praedicentes quae non ſignificantur naturalibus cauſis. i.e.</hi> Many Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers foretell many things which are not ſignified by natural cauſes, ſelling their predictions (under the name of Aſtrological) for money, making the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to believe them.</q> And <hi>Will.

For as
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:121621:52"/>God is the Creatour of all things ſo is he the firſt cauſe of all cauſes, to whom all cauſes are but his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and therefore as the inſtrument worketh not of it ſelf, but when it is imployed by the hand of the Artificer, ſo the Heavens being Gods inſtruments, do not exerciſe their force upon theſe inferiour things, but as God doth uſe their Miniſtery in the Government of the world.</q> And this he ſaith is taught us by the Prophet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> (as aboveſaid) <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.21, 22. where (ſaith he) he ſaith, <q>not ſimply <hi>the heavens ſhall hear the earth,</hi> but firſt, <hi>I will hear the heavens,</hi> to ſhew them the power the heavens have over the earth, and that it dependeth on God.

                  <p>But to come now to the clearing of the Text which he thinks doth abſolutely ſtrike the fatal blow to Aſtrology; inferring from thence, that Aſtrology is oppoſite to confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God, and that Aſtrologers are much of the ſame abomination, with Inchanters and South-ſayers, and that they are to be derided, and no wiſe to be truſted in <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But as I ſaid before, the wit of man is not able to anſwer theſe his vain wreſts and interpretations of the Scriptures, better then by that honourable Gentleman Sir <hi>Christopher Heydon,</hi> I here give you, as he hath it in his ſecond Chapter, in anſwer to M. <hi>Chamber</hi> bringing in the ſame place of Scripture, and indeed with the ſame concluſions as doth M. <hi>Homes.</hi> 
                     <q>I will not deny that, becauſe God and his Prophets were not believed by the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> (who repoſed in their Magicians, South-ſayers, and Mathematicians) the Prophet here in a ſcorning <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſmus,</hi> biddeth them ſave their Empire from ruine, therein contemning their Power, and not their Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and expreſly noting that it ſhall not be in them to ſave themſelves from the judgements to come. This I do plainly acknowledge, although were I diſpoſed to ſtand upon all advantages with M. <hi>Chamber,</hi> ſith both <hi>Vatablus,</hi> and M. <hi>Calvin</hi> in their Commentaries, confeſs that word <hi>Chabar</hi> doth indifferently ſignifie ſuch obſervers of Heaven as were Inchanters thereof; I could eaſily avoid him as not diſputing <hi>ad idem,</hi> ſith not Aſtrologers ſimply, but ſuch as withall joyned <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,</hi> ſeems here to be mentioned. And it is manifeſt by the example of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and of <hi>Balaam</hi> and <hi>Balack,</hi> that though they were Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:121621:53"/>yet they repoſed their ſafety againſt God and his people, onely in their Magical power, by which (as their Poets and others report) they profeſs themſelves able to pull the Moon and the Starrs out of Heaven, and ſo doth <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> teſtific, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. that though they were cunning in Aſtrology, yet they did onely prevent the cvils which they did fore-ſee, by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments and Charmes. For in truth. <hi>Aſtrology</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth onely to fore ſee natural mutations and accidents, and not power to prevent and ſave. But to return to that which he moſt expects, I will admit as much as M. <hi>Chamber</hi> himſelf can deſire, that the Prophet here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rideth the <hi>truſt</hi> which was put in the <hi>skill</hi> of <hi>Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> (which is indeed M. <hi>Homes</hi> his chief drift alſo) now let him frame his argument, and he ſhall never be able to bring the propoſition of this Chapter (which is, That Chriſtianity and Aſtrology cannot ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) (which indeed is M. <hi>Homes</hi> his argument alſo, concluding Aſtrology, to be oppoſite to confidence in God) within this concluſion. For it followeth not, that becauſe upon ſome circumſtance a thing may be derided, that it is unlawfull. If this were any conſequence, then becauſe confidences in Princes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.16. in Riches, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52. in Horſes and Chariots, <hi>Eſay</hi> 31. in Cities, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. in Phyſicians, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. in Negotiation or Trade of Merchandiſe. In the laſt verſe of this ſame Chapter of <hi>Eſay,</hi> (where the ſame words and phraſe are uſed againſt Merchants, that before were uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Obſervers of Heaven, or Aſtrologers, as <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> and <hi>Tremelius</hi> tranſlate it) is prohibited, derided, and puniſhed; we muſt hold the <hi>permiſſion of Princes, Riches, Horſes, Chariots, Cities, Phyſicians,</hi> and <hi>Merchants,</hi> to be againſt Chriſtianity, and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. He ought therefore firſt to have diſtinguiſhed of the truſt that is here derided, and not thus to deceive by any <hi>elench, â dicto ſecundùm quid ad dictum ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
                        <pb n="99" facs="tcp:121621:53"/>as if all truſt were taken away, becauſe ſome truſt is derided. For in theſe places, and the like, onely ſuch a truſt as excludeth confidence in God is underſtood, and no other. As in our caſe, where notwithſtanding God by his Prophets threatned the deſtruction of the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſh</hi> Monarchy, it was not believed; but theſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then preſuming rather upon their own power and skill, in contempt of God broke forth, as appeareth verſe 10. into theſe blaſphemous ſpeeches, <hi>None ſeeth me. Quaſi dicat</hi> (ſaith <hi>Tremelius</hi>) <hi>ne deus quidem novit rationes meas; Nay God himſelf knoweth not my wayes;</hi> and again, <hi>I am and none elſe;</hi> and verſe 7. <hi>I ſhall not ſit as a widow, nor ſhall not know the loſs of Children:</hi> Thus denying both God and his power; while they preſume upon their own. But is this heatheniſh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and confidence to be imputed as a fault to Aſtrology? or is it not truly to be reputed the impiety of the Profeſſours, and others, with whom the Prophet dealeth? who denying that to God which is due, and aſcribing more then they ought to the Starrs, and their own knowledge and power, do that which Aſtrology never taught them, and therefore is not guilty of their ungodlineſs. He ought then to make a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Heathen, with whom the Prophet hath to do, and Chriſtians againſt whom he writeth; for though it be true that Chriſtian Aſtrologers do monethly progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticate, as is mentioned in the Text, by the conſideration of the Starrs; yet is he not able to tax any of them with that derogation from God, or impiety, which is here derided. For to place confidence in Starrs, as in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine cauſes and powers, is one thing, and to eſteem them but as ſubordinate and ſecond cauſes in nature, is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the one maketh them Gods, the other but Gods inſtruments, which (as our Aſtrologers do acknowledge with one conſent) it is in his power to alter, as beſt pleaſeth his divine will; and therefore they are very farr
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:121621:54"/>from that heatheniſh preſumption and confidence here taxed, whereby ye may ſee, <hi>that the truſt may be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, yet the Art unchecked.</hi> For I omit here to ſhew, that monethly Prognoſtications grounded upon obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, deduced from cauſes in nature, have ever been permitted and ſuffered, in all well ordered and Chriſtian Common-wealths, ſo farr as I know; and that not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and thoſe later Divines by me before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, but even M. <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf, in his admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with others (that attribute as little as they may to this Art) do allow thereof, ſo farr forth as they extend to the ſtate of the <hi>weather,</hi> of <hi>health, plague, plenty, dearth,</hi> and to the direction of the <hi>Phyſician,</hi> when to <hi>purge</hi> by <hi>Pill.</hi> when by <hi>Potion,</hi> when by <hi>letting of bloud;</hi> this being as farr as our Prognoſtications pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; which nevertheleſs would not have been ſuffered, if God by his holy Prophet had ſhewed any deteſtation thereof, or reproved the ſame as unlawfull, and unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. Wherefore when theſe adverſaries condemn the Art for the abuſes of Artiſts, it is clear that they do but play the Sophiſters, deceiving by a plain fallacy, <hi>ab ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidente.</hi> And laſtly, if it be conſidered what S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, Hugo, Aquinas, Lyra, Haymo,</hi> and other ancient Expoſitours, have written upon the Text, it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that not one of them is ſo ſharp ſighted as to eſpy out any thing in this place that may prejudicat Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, but they all defend the ſame as fully as my ſelf.</q> Wherefore if in this place of Scripture M. <hi>Homes</hi> be not as farr miſtaken as in all the reſt of his foregoing Cavils, and maketh not himſelf appear to the eyes of the world to be a meer Sophiſter, let the impartial judge.</p>

And how.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, as <hi>oppoſits to confidence in God:</hi> as our Notes on
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:121621:60"/>the Bible affirm in theſe words. [He derideth <hi>(ſay they)</hi> their vain confidence, that put their truſt in any thing but in God, condemning alſo ſuch Sciences which ſerve to no uſe, but to delude the people, and to bring them from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as of the ſame rank, and much of the ſame abomination with Inchanters and Sorcerers. <hi>Babylon</hi> uſeth both; and as we heard afore, from them that went farr in Aſtrology; that Aſtrologers that uſually hit any thing right, cannot do it but by help from the Devil.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as a thing to be <hi>derided,</hi> that any man ſhould undertake to preſage good, when 'tis the counſel of God to bring evil upon a people.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, as <hi>a juſt thing with God</hi> to ſend ſuch to their Aſtrologers in the day of evil of judgement on them, to ſee if they can deliver them.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, as that God <hi>will the rather bring irreſiſtible judgement</hi> on a people that beſides their evils, do believe Aſtrologers that they ſhall do well.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, that in the day of calamity, eſpecially Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers, and thoſe that believed them ſhall fall by the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt fury of the judgement.</p>
                  <p>The fifth place of Scripture againſt Aſtrology is <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.2, 3. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Learn not the way of the Heathen, and be not diſmayed at the Signes of Heaven, for the Heathen are diſmayed at them. For the customes of the people are vain.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>a ſign or token,</hi> doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times and eſpecially when joyned with Heaven, ſignifies a prodigious, portentous, ominous ſign. The word is the ſame, and the intent of the Text the ſame, as in <hi>Iſai</hi> 44.24, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (afore diſcuſſed) <hi>that frustrateth the Tokens, or ſignes of the Lyars.</hi> The <hi>Geneva</hi> on our Bibles on the word <hi>[Signes]</hi> ſay thus; [God forbiddeth his people to give credit or fear the Conſtellations and Conjunctions of Starrs and Planets, which have no power of themſelves, but are governed by him; and their ſecret motions and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:121621:60"/>influences are not known to man, and therefore there can be no certain judgement thereof. <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.9.] And the ſame <hi>Geneva</hi> Notes on the word <hi>[Cuſtomes]</hi> ſay thus; [Meaning (ſay they) not onely the obſervation of the Starrs, but their Laws and Ceremonies, whereby they confirm their Idolatry] ſo the <hi>Geneva</hi> Notes. I quote them and others the more, that ye may ſee, not onely mine, but the judgement of the generality of the godly and learned touching Aſtrology. I add, as Aſtrology and Idolatry are conjoyned here in the prohibition, ſo alſo was it in the practiſe of men: for they idolatrouſly made Gods of the Starrs, as of <hi>Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, &amp;c.</hi> as the names of our week-dayes do unhappily to this day ſignifie. And they alſo did aſtrologically uſe them to foretell by. And indeed in Prediction by them they made gods of them. For future things are in Gods hands, and not for us to know till he will make them known by his Word; or perform them, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.7. The <hi>Chaldee</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe renders that of the Text of <hi>Signes</hi> thus; <hi>And be not afraid of the Signes that are put in Heaven:</hi> which muſt needs fignifie the <hi>Starrs:</hi> and the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word for <hi>fear</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſignifies to caſt down upon the earth with fear; which muſt intimate rather a <hi>fear</hi> of <hi>evil ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications,</hi> then of <hi>adoration.</hi> The intimations againſt Aſtrology here, are,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that it is the <hi>way of the Heathen.</hi> Now we, whom God hath with ſo much coſt and care diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the World, muſt not imitate the World, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.32. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that the <hi>Cuſtomes of the people</hi> in that and other things, are vain; and 'tis not for Gods people to run after vain things but rather as a ſign of their repentance to do as <hi>Solomon Eccleſ.</hi> 1.2. and <hi>Paul. Phil.</hi> 3.7, 8.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the regarding of ſuch things cauſeth in men <hi>an evil fear,</hi> oppoſite to their confidence and comfort in God: ſo the Prophet intimates in exhorting them not <hi>to fear them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:121621:61"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, that to fear any Aſtrology or ſignes <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is an <hi>heatheniſh thing:</hi> We do not as Believers, but as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. Godly men, yea all men that profeſs the true God, ought to go to that God, and to him onely to know the hidden things that are future. For it is the priviledge of God onely, to foretell ſuch things to come, either by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf or by his ſpirit extraordinarily in his Prophets; and therefore not communicated to Starrs: and whatſoever we ſet up, as imagining they are able to predict ſuch fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture things, we advance up into the place of God, which are not Gods; as is manifeſt by this very thing, that they cannot really and truly predict ſuch things: and therefore to go to any thing to know ſuch things to come, but to God himſelf, is to do as Heathens that ſet up falſe gods, and not as men that acknowledge the true God. All this is fully and plainly held ſorth to us in <hi>Iſai</hi> 41.21.22, 23, 24. In <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. to 21. the Lord having propheſied and foretolá good things to come to paſs for his people, he in a holy manner thus taunteth all other things that are ſet up by men in which they put confidence, as if they were Gods to declare hidden things <hi>paſt,</hi> or <hi>to come;</hi> verſe 21. <hi>&amp;c. Produce your cauſe ſaith the Lord bring forth your ſtrong reaſons ſaith the King of</hi> Jacob; <hi>let them hring forth, and ſhew us what ſhall happen. Let them ſhew the former things what they be, that we may conſider them, and know the later end of them, or declare to us things to come: Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know ye are Gods, &amp;c. Behold ye are of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We do not count it inconſiderable to our buſineſs to diſcuſs here what is the thing mainly meant in this place; as whether <hi>Idolatry</hi> or <hi>Astrology</hi> (ſure enough in Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy by them that confide in it for Predictions, there is <hi>Idolatry</hi> enough, as this Text ſufficiently intimateth) but we attend the Argument to confute it <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>foretell things to come; becauſe that is Gods Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:121621:61"/>alone:</hi> and therefore nor <hi>Idols</hi> nor <hi>Stacrs;</hi> neither <hi>Idols</hi> nor <hi>Starrs;</hi> neither <hi>Idolatry</hi> nor <hi>Astrology</hi> can predict things to come: for as <hi>Idolatry</hi> is but <hi>vanity,</hi> as 'tis oft called in Scripture: as <hi>the vanites of the Nations, or Gentiles &amp;c.</hi> So Aſtrology is a <hi>lye, Jer.</hi> 60.35.36. <hi>A Sword is upon the</hi> Chadeans, <hi>&amp;c. and upon her Princes and upon her wiſe men: a Sword is upon the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, and they ſhall dote.</hi> Upon which word learned <hi>Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torf</hi> (<hi>ad vocem</hi>

                  <p>But for the reaſon, if any could be given, <hi>Scaliger</hi> was likely to give as good as another, and yet his reaſon
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:121621:70"/>is, that the Scripture put this name upon the God of <hi>Ek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> by way of <hi>deriſion, quòd in Templo Hieroſolymitano Muſcae carnes victimarum non liguriebant, quum tamen Gentium fana à muſcis infeſtarentur propter nidorem vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctimarum.</hi>

                  <p>Thus farre <hi>J. G.</hi> and the learned Antiquities in him. Judge now whether Aſtrology be not Demonologicall, Diabolicall, Deviliſh!</p>
                  <p>To the <hi>Paragraph</hi> noted with (C) we ſay, that if the word <hi>be admitted as in the Engliſh,</hi> with the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſo many Churches, and in ſo many languages and reaſons upon it as hath been declared, the intent of the Text muſt neceſſarily be to condemn <hi>judiciall Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie.</hi> And the allegation of <hi>Solomon</hi> in <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a <hi>prudentiall obſerving</hi> of <hi>preſent providences and times</hi> allotted by God for men to lay hold on, if wſie, is a meer impertinency, as to predictions of future times, by Aſtrology. And the <hi>diſtinction</hi> annext is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a <hi>generall Epithite</hi> or name of all Judiciall Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, that tis all <hi>Heatheniſh,</hi> and <hi>ſuperſtitious</hi> as hath been, and will be more made to appear. <hi>Williams</hi> large quotation of Sir <hi>Ch.</hi> his alleadging Maſter <hi>E. Lively</hi> Profeſſour of Hebrew, &amp;c. amounts in reality but to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:121621:70"/>this: firſt, that M. <hi>Lively</hi> ingenuouſly <hi>confeſſeth, that among the diverſities of men, and their opinions, there is</hi> general agreement <hi>that the word ſignifieth an</hi> unlawfull <hi>and</hi> forbidden Art, <hi>as ſuppoſe of Southſaying juggling, witchcraft &amp;c.</hi> which how ſufficiently they comprehend <hi>Astrology</hi> I did but now declare; and how when divers words to ſignifie divers unlawfull Arts of unlawfull Prognoſtication, come together, that which neareſt ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the manner, matter, and means of Aſtrological <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> muſt needs there ſignifie <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> the Doctour hath ſufficiently declared. Secondly, <q>
                        <hi>That M.</hi> Lively <hi>acknowledgeth the word is taken to ſignifie ſuch as take upon them to define times of good and bad luck:</hi>
                     </q> which is the dayly practiſe of our Aſtrologers in theſe times. Thirdly, that yet M. <hi>Lively</hi> doth not confeſs all the truth, either of the readings of the Learned, or the Reaſons in Text, to prove the word ſignifies Aſtrology, which the Doctour clearly produceth. It was too common in Sir <hi>Christopher's</hi> time, for a Profeſſour of the Univerſities too much to pleaſe Courtiers and great men: of which if M. <hi>Lively</hi> were free (as my Charity would willingly think) yet he could but produce his own reading, and Books then known to him. We have had the <hi>Samaritan, Syriack</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> Tranſlations of the Bible brought over ſince. Thirdly, for M. <hi>Lively's</hi> oppoſing <hi>Tremelius,</hi> a moſt learned Chriſtian <hi>Jew,</hi> whom the learned World admire to this day, I muſt juſtly undervalue him to great <hi>Tremelius:</hi> and if <hi>Tremelius</hi> according to the nature and circumſtances of the place doth ſometimes render the word <hi>Praestigiatores,</hi> that is, as M. <hi>Lively</hi> calls them, Jugglers, that word (as the Doctour hath ſhewed) doth very conveniently comprehend the Aſtrologer. <q>As for <hi>Will. Ramſey's Ignoramus,</hi> that Doctour <hi>Homes</hi> quotes <hi>Arabick verſions,</hi>

And that <hi>Judicial Astrology</hi> is not free from all kinde of Witchcraft, Southſaying, and Juggling; but guilty of <hi>Superstition,</hi> Deviliſine, Heatheniſme, and profaneneſs, let M.

If the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word is derived of <hi>Time,</hi> then in its native ſignification it doth more then barely ſignifie <hi>Divination</hi> in general; it ſpecially relates to <hi>Aſtrology</hi> that undertakes to predict touching humane affairs, by or from the <hi>times</hi> or turnings of the Heavens.

And <hi>Williams brave reaſon</hi> is a <hi>weak reaſon</hi> that ponderating Tranſlatours ſhould uſe words for <hi>brevity of oration.</hi> Tis true indeed that it is their wiſedome as farre as the word will bear, to give the moſt comprchenſive ſignification, becauſe the mind of the <hi>holy ſpirit</hi> is ſuch. But every generall comprehends the particulars, as he that ſaith <hi>William Ramſey</hi> to be an animal ſaith true; he that ſaith he is an ignorant man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſaith he is an animal; <hi>ergo,</hi> he that ſaith he is an ignorant man ſaith true. This is better logick, then <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi> endeavour to make the Scriptures oppoſite to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Where the <hi>word</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved.</hi> the circumſtances of the place ſhew the meaning to be of juſtifying faith in Chriſt, whoſe property is, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>to work by love.</hi> But by the Devils be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, Saint <hi>James</hi> plainly ſignifies ſuch a faith as works not by love. And therefore if <hi>Williams</hi> or any mans faith hath no love; it is no better then the Devils faith. Thats true Logick, and according to the mind of S. <hi>James.</hi> Beſide all this, note that <hi>W. R.</hi> ſaith nothing to the Doctours reaſon from the word EAST, proving thereby <hi>Chaldeans</hi> or <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> to be there meant.

The diſtinction of making <hi>ſtars cauſes,</hi> and <hi>ſubordinate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,</hi> comes to nothing, as in <hi>Logick,</hi> (for <hi>inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> are <hi>cauſes</hi>) ſo in the preſent diſpute about <hi>Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Aſtrology.</hi> For <hi>Will.

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:121621:73"/>in the ſtars is very great.

And laſtly, if any times or places have not puniſhed ſuch, tis but their <hi>permiſſion</hi> and <hi>ſufferance</hi> (as the objectours words are) which is of <hi>unlawfull things,</hi> properly. 7.

                  <p>To <hi>VV.</hi> his fifth Sect. of Ch. 39. touching <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.2.3. I do anſwer, that in this Section alſo <hi>VVill.</hi> hath yet his Spokes-man Sir <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> to ſpeak for him. Sir <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher</hi> diſputes, and <hi>Will. (more ſuo)</hi> railes. But neither of them ſpeak any thing to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Chaldee</hi> of the Text; or to the <hi>Geneva</hi> Notes once, or the Reaſons, and deductions from it, againſt <hi>Aſtrology;</hi> all which are to good purpoſe preſſed by the Doctour. See afore <hi>VVill.</hi> ſaith, The <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> do not in the leaſt attribute fatal neceſſity to the power of the Starrs. But Sir <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> aſſerted (as we heard afore) that their power cannot be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered without a miracle. And <hi>Will.</hi> all along avoucheth the certainty of <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> and with many high epithes of a moſt divine, moſt heavenly Art, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with ſeverall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his Diagrams of Figures. Put all together, and it can ſpell no leſs then that (in their opinion) the Stars hold forth a neceſſity of certainty in the <hi>power</hi> of the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. And though the <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> confeſs the Starrs to be Gods inſtruments (as the <hi>Jews</hi> did) yet may they
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:121621:74"/>by confidence in their effects deifie and idolize them, as did the <hi>Jews</hi> in ſome of thoſe places alleadged after by Sir <hi>Chriſtopher.</hi> The Papiſts confeſs their images to be in themſelves, but creatures; and therefore aſſert they worſhip not the images, but God in or through them. But the orthodox Chriſtian World do generally and juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemn them guilty of Idolatry by the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, forbidding any Image to be made in relation to divine Worſhip. The <hi>Jews Exod.</hi> 32. could not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be ſo ſtupid as to think that the molten Calf made of their own ear-rings could be a real Deity.

                     <hi>i.e. A Solemnity or Feaſt to</hi> Jehovah: yet the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.7. expreſly calls their reſpect to God in, through, or by that image, by the name of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Be ye not Idolaters as were ſome of them, as it is written:</hi> (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.6.) <hi>The People ſate down to eat and drink and roſe up to play.</hi> The Doctour in his exercitation upon this place of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> (preſented to the Reader a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did effectually urge that the ſcope of it was to aſſert that thoſe that go to the Starrs to fore-know future hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane events do therein make them Gods; in attributing to them thereby, propheſying, which is peculiar to God, either immediately by oracle, or mediately by his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary inſpiration in the Prophets. To which as I ſaid, <hi>Will. Ram.</hi> hath anſwered nothing. But I will leave <hi>Williams</hi> triflings, and come to Sir <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> who ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues like a Gentleman, and a Scholar (for whoſe ſake this Survey is carried on thus farr; for without him <hi>Will.</hi> had lain ſo naked that he would of himſelf ſoon have ſterved, or beaten himſelf with ſtriving unto death. All that Sir <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> ſaith is but two things. Firſt, that this place
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:121621:75"/>ſpeaketh of things, <hi>viz.</hi> Starrs, not of perſons, <hi>viz. Starr-gazers.</hi> Secondly, That adoration of Starrs is here forbidden, not <hi>Aſtrological Predictions</hi> by them.</p>
                  <p>To the firſt, my Reply is, <hi>Perſons, viz.</hi> Gazers upon Starrs are here meant: for Sir <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> confeſſeth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons adoring or worſhipping the Starrs are here repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; which adoration could not be without gazing or looking on the Starrs. But as the adoration of them that have worſhipped the Starrs muſt needs begin from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the glory of them, or elſe they worſhipped they knew not what, ſo their worſhip was acted by looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: <hi>Job</hi> 26.27. <hi>If I beheeld the Sun when it ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or the Moon walking in brightneſs my heart hath been ſecretly enticed or my mouth hath kiſſed mine hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is at the beginning and ending of this Text of <hi>Jeremy, Learn not the way of the heathen, and the cuſtomes of the People are vain.</hi> Therefore <hi>Perſons</hi> acting in relation to Starrs muſt neceſſarily here be underſtood. To the two particulars of Sir <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> that here is forbidden <hi>Divine worſhip</hi> of Starrs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not Aſtrological contemplation and Prediction of and by them; I ſay that Sir <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> firſt Reaſon that <hi>fear</hi> is often uſed to ſignifie <hi>worſhip,</hi> is too weak for his deſign here: for firſt, when <hi>fear</hi> is put with its <hi>object,</hi> unleſs the object named be the true God or Idol, it doth not (that I know) ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <hi>worſhip:</hi> as <hi>fear</hi> not <hi>them that kill the body, Matth.</hi> 10.28. Give <hi>fear</hi> to <hi>whom</hi> fear is due. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.7. Ye ſhall <hi>fear</hi> every man his <hi>Mother: Lev.</hi> 19.3. <hi>Fear</hi> not the <hi>People</hi> of the Land: <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.9. with hundreds more of inſtances; where <hi>fear</hi> doth not at all ſignifie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worſhip. But ſecondly, (which is farr more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable) Sir <hi>Christopher</hi> is extremely miſtaken in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> word, that in <hi>Iſay</hi> 29.13. ſignifieth <hi>fear,</hi> how dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent it is from the word in <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.2. Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Heydon</hi> extremely miſtaks the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Text; yea, moſt inconſiderately runs away with a notion in his own head,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:121621:75"/>that he regards not the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Text. For this of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> in both the old Tranſlations is, <hi>Be not afraid for the ſignes of Heaven; the heathen be afraid of ſuch.</hi> And in our laſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation it is, <hi>Be not diſmayed.</hi> All moſt ſutable to the force of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which (as the Doctour you ſee afore admoniſhed) ſignifies <hi>to caſt down upon the earth with fear, which muſt intimate ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a fear of evil ſignifications, then of Adoration.</hi> And therefore <hi>W.R.</hi> is infinitely more to be blamed &amp; ſhamed, that would not take warning, but own the allegation of Text with ſo palpable a groſs miſtake. For was there ever ſuch a phraſe extant, or imaginable, that to be <hi>afraid</hi> or to be <hi>diſmayed</hi> ſhould ſignifie <hi>worſhip?</hi> That <hi>conſternation &amp; throwing or caſting a man down with horror</hi> (as rightly <hi>Arias</hi> renders our word by <hi>conſternari</hi>) ſhould ſignifie <hi>divine adoration?</hi> But there is more then that to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, which lies in the <hi>phraſe,</hi> (beſides the ſingle word) <hi>viz.</hi>

Nor was <hi>Calvin</hi> moved by any, or diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to wrangle, when he wrote his Commentary on <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah;</hi> yet he largely (beyond his wont) doth interpret this ſecond <hi>verſ.</hi> of the tenth Chapter of <hi>Judicial Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> to the value of near one whole leaf. or half ſheet in <hi>folio,</hi> in which he hath ſome ſtrong and ſtinging paſſages againſt it. <hi>Ne metuatis, vel ne expaveſcatis ſignis coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtibus:</hi>

                     <q>Be not afraid, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is, let not men feign to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves good or ill fortune, by the poſition, or aſpect of the Stars. If the Stars do preſage to us good or ill fortune, we have cauſe to be afraid of them. But the Prophet calls them here <hi>Signes</hi> in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper ſenſe; becauſe he hath no reſpect to their true original, but accommodateth his ſpeech to thoſe perverſe Errours which then prevailed. And we muſt remember, what I touched afore that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans</hi> were given to that Aſtrology, which at this day we call <hi>Judicial,</hi> or <hi>Judiciary.</hi> For the bare name, in it ſelf it may be eaſily admitted, but long ſince. <hi>By wicked Knaves it was made a prophane thing.</hi> For that Art was adulterated among the <hi>Chaldeans.</hi> That therefore the minde of the Prophet may be certainly clear to us, let that Principle ſtand fixed, that the Sun and the Moon the reſt of the Planets, and the fixed Stars which are in the Firmament, are Signes. But withall here muſt be noted the relation. Wherefore would then God have the Sun and the Moon to be for Signes. Namely, that the courſe of the Moon might perfect one moneth, the courſe of the Sun, one year, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Again, the Sun as it
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:121621:76"/>hath reſpect to the twelve Signes one while it makes Spring, another while Summer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and other things blonging to the <hi>Order of Nature.</hi> But whoſoever will ſtretch out theſe Signes beyond that, doth utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the order propounded of God. Even as formerly when the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans</hi> would ſware higher then reaſon did bear, they would conjecture by the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Stars, <hi>What ſhould be the events of all Nations.</hi> After that they durſt deſcend to all particular men. Hence ſprung the <hi>Nativity-caſters.</hi> Therefore they firſt began to philoſophize more ſubtilly, that the Sun when it was under ſuch a Sign, it portended the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of the onely childe; happy events to another. But theſe things are <hi>without the bound of the accuſtomed courſe of Nature.</hi> For inſtance, to be Summerand Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, this is natural and ordinary; but that <hi>warr is moved</hi> by one Nation againſt another, this is not of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed courſe of Nature, nor from thence, but from the ambition and covetouſneſs of men. Indeed a ſecret providence of God over-ruleth; but we ſpeak of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which may be weighed and comprehended by us as falling under ſenſe. Albeit this alſo is to be noted, <hi>The courſe of the Stars of themſelves have no matter of moment.</hi> For we ſee how God varieth times; we have not equal Winters or Summers neither is there a conſtant temper: no year but is unlike to the former; and the third unlike to the ſecond, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sometimes the air will ſeem temperate, yet the Plague will deſtroy: Sometimes there cannot be found a reaſon why the year ſhould bring ſcarcity, and yet men may be pined. So that God according to his own good pleaſure tempers the world otherwiſe then any the acuteſt is able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine by Stars. <hi>But they that will tranſcend the bounds that God hath ſet will alſo conjecture by the Stars whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther war ſhould be in that countrey, or peace in another.</hi> They therefore that will collect by the Stars the things
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:121621:77"/>that are beſide the courſe of Nature, they ſurely mingle Heaven and Earth together. Neither is there any doubt, but that the Prophet chaſtiſeth this <hi>madneſs,</hi> whiles he forbids the <hi>Jews</hi> to <hi>attend</hi> unto the <hi>Signes</hi> of Heaven, as to be <hi>afraid</hi> of them. But withall the reaſon is to be attended why the Prophet ſo grievouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth that <hi>Fear</hi> which reigned among the Heathens, to wit, becauſe where this opinion prevailed, <hi>That all events of things depend upon the Stars, the fear of God is taken away faith is extinguiſhed, &amp;c.</hi> For all <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers</hi> who falſely uſurp that name to themſelves, I ſay, <hi>thoſe Knaves,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lat. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulones iſtos di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co.</note> who for their Impoſtures pretend the name of <hi>Judiciary</hi> or <hi>Judicial Aſtrology,</hi> do conclude that a Judgement, or determination, or Prognoſtick, touching the life of man ought to be made by the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſcope;</hi> as if both fortunes depended on the Stars. If therefore any man be born at this hour, according to their opinion, that condition ſhall abide him; ſo toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they feign a fate, to wit, ſome neceſſity which may hold a man bound to the rule of the Sun, and Moon, and Stars. For one born when the Sun was in the tail of ſuch a Sign, or when it was in the head of another, this Nativity portends ſuch or ſuch a fortune; this man ſhall be of a ſhort life, the other of a longer. At length they alſo gather to themſelves more boldneſs, and will pronounce concerning every day, ſuch an event waits upon this expedition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After that, when or where the Nativity cannot be brought into conſideration, they ſubject all man-kinde to the neceſſity of the Stars; behold if thou undertake any Expedition, this or that day, it ſhall be well with thee; but if thou haſten afore noon, ill ſucceſs attends thee. So therefore they divine of the whole life of man, and each ſingle action; when as God would not have the Conftellations and Stars to be for Signes to this end or uſe. Now, as I ſaid, hence it follows, God doth not govern as to reign; ſo faith is
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:121621:77"/>extinguiſhed, and all duties of piety are reduced to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. For whoſoever is perſwaded that he is bound by this neceſſity, that becauſe ſuch is the Horoſcope, he muſt neceſſarily periſh in that hour, and alſo neceſſarily periſh by this kinde of death, he therefore being thus perſwaded, will he call upon God? Will he commend his life to him? Again, if any adverſity befall him, will he impute it to his ſins? Will he acknowledge that he is called unto judgement by God? Or if it be proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous with him, will he be excited to ſing praiſes to God? We <hi>ſee therefore how this Divination extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth all Godlineſs;</hi> becauſe there will be no faith; and then no acknowledgement of puniſhments, no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the benefits of God, no induſtry in praying, <hi>If once that diabolical Errour hath poſſeſſed</hi> or <hi>ſurprized our mindes,</hi> that we are <hi>ſubject to the Stars, ſuch is our Nativity,</hi> and further <hi>that the Stars</hi> each <hi>ſingle day</hi> and <hi>moment</hi> portend ſome kinde of <hi>death.</hi> This therefore we ought chiefly to think upon when the Prophet forbiddeth the <hi>Jews to be afraid of the Signes of Heaven.</hi> Neither is there any doubt but that the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> did predict that a <hi>new Empire was promiſed unto them;</hi> ſo terrified the poor <hi>Jews,</hi> far well to us. For ſo the <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> ſpake among the <hi>Chaldeans.</hi> And then on the other part, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſaw this to be foretold by the poſition of the Stars: ſo it was that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſunck as ſpiritleſs or unſouled. And ſo it came not into their mindes that God had ſo often, and ſo many years threatened them by his Prophets, whiles they ceaſed not to provoke his anger againſt themſelves. The judgement then of God they counted as nothing; and yet the mean while this did aſtoniſh them that the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> had diſcerned by the Stars that there would be ſome change. By this time we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the minde of the Prophet, where he ſaith, <hi>We must not be afraid of the Stars.</hi> I know how many at
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:121621:78"/>this day are <hi>fooliſhly curious,</hi> and therefore ſome way given to <hi>Judicial Astrology;</hi> and this <hi>Dotage</hi> hath violently curried away ſome men otherwiſe pious, and very learned. But we ſee what here God pronounceth by his ſervant.</q> And I wonder that ſome men are ſo addicted to the Stars, who too too philoſophically ſpeak of free will. Thus <hi>Calvin,</hi> whom I have repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed largely, and yet have brought you but part of what he ſaith. So you have heard a moſt pious and learned man, uningaged from any <hi>wrangling,</hi> clear this Text to ſignifie <hi>Judicial Astrology.</hi>

                  <p>Sir <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> third Reaſon, that the <hi>Jews</hi> worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Stars is here meant (not <hi>Aſtrology</hi>) becauſe other Scriptures mention ſuch their worſhipping of the Stars, comes in juſt account, to no more but this, that becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> are guilty of other ſins, reproved in other Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures therefore they are admoniſhed of no other ſin, but of the very ſame here, which connexion is as far wide as the Texts alleadged by Sir <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> are divided in the <hi>Bible</hi> from this of <hi>Jeremiah.</hi> All that Sir <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> hath of any weight to pretend a piecing up of ſuch a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence is (noted with) or this of <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>The cuſtomes of the people are vain, for one cutteth down a tree in the forreſt, &amp;c.</hi> which (ſaith Sir <hi>Chriſtopher</hi>) <hi>ſhould want ſenſe, if this verſe depended not on the former.</hi> But the Doctour hath very well anticipated this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his third Section, in his Paragraph on the fifth Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that all <hi>Judicial Aſtrology</hi> includes conſequential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an <hi>Idolatry,</hi> yea, and an <hi>internal idolatrous heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip of Stars;</hi> as hath been largely cleared by <hi>Calvin;</hi> Note further that, <hi>Learn not the</hi> way <hi>of the heathen;</hi> (<hi>v.</hi> 2.) is (ſaith <hi>Calvin</hi>) <hi>Praeceptum generale;</hi> the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the prohibition. The particulars are two. Firſt, the forbidding of <hi>Judicial Aſtrology,</hi> containing heart-Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry; fearing with that fear, that thing and therein; which is due onely to God, <hi>v.</hi> 2. The ſecond is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:121621:78"/>Idolomany, <hi>Idoloxoyie,</hi> containing outward corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral worſhip of Images; <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But how doth that ſame <hi>For</hi> in the third <hi>verſ.</hi> come logically in? Anſwer, Firſt, the Prophet thereby takes them off of <hi>the wayes of the heathen</hi> in one groſs practiſe, <hi>viz. Astrology,</hi> by proclaiming and inſtancing the vanity of the Heathens in another thing that is more groſs and palpably vain; <hi>viz.</hi> in making and corporally worſhipping material Images. Secondly, <hi>Calvin</hi> makes up the matter of the particle <hi>For,</hi> thus; <hi>Videtur propheta abrumpere, &amp;c. i. e.</hi> 
                     <q>The Prophet ſeems abruptly to break the ſentence, and to reaſon unaptly. For he had ſaid in the former Verſe, <hi>Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not afraid of the Signes of the Heavens, FOR or BECA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE the cuſtomes oſ the people are vain. FOR one cutteth a Tree, &amp;c.</hi> The Prophet therefore ſeems to make his tranſition to Idols, as if he had forgot himſelf. But we muſt mark that the <hi>Jews</hi> were affected with that ancient perſwaſion, that, to wit, the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Egyptians</hi> boaſted that they were the onely wiſe men; and had procured to themſelves that fame among all Nations. For we ſee alſo that profane Writers when they ſpeak of the riſe of all Sciences, they attribute it to the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans</hi> and <hi>Egyptians.</hi> For among them 'tis ſaid, was born or ſprang up Aſtrology, and all Liberal Sciences. There is no doubt therefore but that the <hi>Jews</hi> would aſſcribe ſo much authority to the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that their mindes being ſeiſed upon are poſſeſt with that prejudice they would ſee nothing. Therefore the Propher ſhaketh out of them, this negligence, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrateth that they were fooliſh, notwithſtanding they would be the onely wiſe men and account others in compariſon of them to be barbarous and ſilly. Now therefore we ſee why the Prophet knitteth on idolatry with that falſe and adulterate <hi>Aſtrology</hi> of which afore.</q> So <hi>Calvin.</hi>

                  <head>VV. R. his <hi>SECT. I.</hi> VVherein, as he ſaith, the Doctours fore-fold reaſon is convinced.</head>
                  <p>HIs firſt reaſon then is, (to prove Aſtrology is falſe) that <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> themſelves confeſſe, <hi>that either the prudence of amortall wiſe man, or the piety of a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, or the tutelarity of Angels, or the providence of God, over-ruling all things, may prevent their predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. VVhereupon he concludes that</hi> Aſtrology is falſe; <hi>for ſaith he, what humane providence cannot do grace can; if not, Angels may; and where all fail, providence doth or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der according to the mind of God, &amp;c.</hi> To anſwer this his moſt weak cavil, I ſhall begin with what he ſets down laſt, viz. <hi>The providence of God over-ruling all things,</hi> which he ſaith himſelf (as well as the other three clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) is the conceſſion of <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> themſelves, and if ſo, I would demand then what advantage he hath here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, againſt Aſtrology; when he can ſay no more againſt it, then what the Practitioners in the Art do confeſſe themſelves? <hi>there is certainly none but wretched A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts, that will deny, that God hath not an over-ruling, and reſtraining power over all things,</hi> as well celeſtiall, as terreſtriall; but whether his will and pleaſure be to <hi>alter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ir naturall courſes,</hi> is a queſtion, but he hath heard that <hi>Ptolomy</hi> himſelf, nay and all Aſtrologers in
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:121621:79"/>generall, do attribute nothing (farther then naturall things, which are in ſublunary elementary bodies) to the power and influence of the Stars; He weakly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inferres the Stars not to have power, becauſe God can alter, or is able to alter their motions, influences and effects. I demand then whether Aſtrology be <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall, Idolatrous, the Doctrine or Language of the Devils, or wicked,</hi> as theſe two <hi>ſeeming zealous blades,</hi> moſt falſely, maliciouſly, inconſiderately, and ignorantly traduce it? and then I demand, ſince as the Philoſopher ſaith, ignorance is the enemy of all good learning, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they deſerve not exemplary puniſhment, to condemn ſo noble, ſo profitable to the Common-wealth, ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, ſo divine, and ſo pleaſing a ſtudy, as Aſtrology is teaching and traducing their vile ignorance to the world; and truly as one of them moſt wiſely ſaid, if he ſhould make appear what he knoweth of ſome Aſtrologers, the Parliament would make a Law againſt it, as ſometimes was done in the Senate of <hi>Rome;</hi> but would he becon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent all Divines ſhould be ſilenced, becauſe ſome are Knaves, and prate non-ſenſe, and ſo conſequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude no verity or truth in <hi>Divinity?</hi> Truly might I be worthy to adviſe that High Court; in the ſtead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning and prohibiting this moſt worthy ſtudy, they would do well to prohibit all ſuch Pamphleters, which without either fear or wit, undertake to condemn what they are ignorant of; and that none ſhould be ſuffered to condemn, or falſely undertake to traduce any Art or Science whatſoever, without firſt before the publiſhing of their writings, to make appear to the world, that they are throughly verſt and read in the Art they undertake to condemn. <hi>The verity whereof, as alſo its legality, I dare undertake to defend, not onely againſt what they can ſay againſt it; but alſo all the Divines in</hi> England <hi>(put together to help them) can imagine or contrive to ſay.</hi> But to return to our buſineſſe in hand, Maſter <hi>Homes</hi> on
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:121621:80"/>his fore-fold argument, brings this concluſion, <hi>that God worketh not by the ſtars as ſecundary cauſes, but</hi> Eph. 1.11. <hi>he ruleth all things after the counſell of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine will.</hi> If becauſe God ruleth all things after the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of his own will; he worketh not by cauſes: then, to what purpoſe I pray you are Armies, and the ſucceſſe ſometimes this way, ſometimes that, till in concluſion the victory is fully obtained on one ſide or other? will he ſay, (notwithſtanding the various ſucceſſe of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in time of the war) that it was not concluded in the counſell of Gods own will, that the victory ſhould be given on that ſide?</p>

Sect. 4. (which is that <hi>VV. R.</hi> here would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed) word for word, Section 4. <q>
                        <hi>Conteining reaſons or arguments against Aſtrology. The firſt is from the conceſſion of the <hi>friends of Aſtrology.</hi> They grant that either of theſe foure may prevent the predictions of Aſtrology; namely, either the prudence of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall wiſe man, or the piety of a godly mun, or the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellarity of Angel, or the providence of God, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling all things; much more all four concurring may anticipate. Now theſe four ſwallow up, and gripe within their ſphereall things, eſpeciall arbitrary things: what humane prudence cannot do, grace can; if not, Angels may: and where all fail, providence doth order according to the mind of God, <hi>who worketh</hi> All <hi>things according to the counſell of his own will, Ephiſ.</hi> 1.11. Tis ſaid, <hi>All things;</hi> for, <hi>not a Sparrow falls to the ground without his will. And all the hairs of our head are numbred, Math.</hi> 10.29, 30. Which our
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:121621:81"/>Saviour ſpeaks to comfort Believers againſt bodily dangers, and corporall cauſes of fears. And on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, tis not ſaid in that <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.11. <hi>He work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things according to the</hi> Stars; which are <hi>viſible</hi> things, and <hi>naturall neceſſary cauſes;</hi> but according to the <hi>counſell</hi> (which is ſecret and inviſible) <hi>of his own will</hi> (which is arbitrary and free.) And to expreſſe it more ſignificantly and emphatically, that God doth not rule by a deputation committed to Stars, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in things either humane and arbitrary, or ſpirituall; tis ſaid he <hi>ruleth all things after the counſell of his</hi> own Will. Which being ſet over againſt the many ſoar invectives the Lord makes againſt Aſtrologicall obſervers of the Stars demonſtrate ſufficiently to them that will underſtand, that there is no certainty in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions from the Stars. This argument might be much enlarged to good purpoſe; but a word to the wiſe is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus far the Doctour. By which it appears not onely that <hi>VV. R.</hi> did moſt falſely report him; but alſo that <hi>VVil.</hi> did never rightly apprehend the dint of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours argument from <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.11. which was, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all <hi>humane future</hi> events were ordered according to Gods own <hi>ſecret</hi> will: that therefore we could not by viſion of Stars, or inſpection into conſtellations find <hi>viſible ſigns</hi> of ſuch <hi>humane future</hi> events, which before their fulfilling are <hi>hidden</hi> in the <hi>ſecret</hi> counſell of God. And therefore <hi>VVilliams</hi> quibbles on <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. are meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impertinent, ſhooting at a Butt the Doctour never ſet up. As his frequent compariſon of Aſtrology and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologers, with divinity and Divines; is groſſe enough of it ſelf, to render it ſelfe odious without a confutation. Divinity is the Judge of Aſtrology, therefore the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the Barre muſt not compare with it. And <hi>Calvin</hi> (we heard afore) called <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> KNAVES, that pretended <hi>Aſtrology</hi> for their <hi>Knavery;</hi> but if any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:121621:81"/>be Knaves, it is not as they are Divines.

For <hi>VVilliam</hi> (poore paſſionate ignorant young fellow) is an unfit peece, the Lord knows, to write confutations; and more unfit to give counſell to a <hi>Parliament,</hi> and in a myſtery of iniquity wherein he is a party. Tis true he doth <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> bellow out his high <hi>Throſonicall</hi> Braggs <hi>verbis ſeſquipedalibus</hi> without meaſure, <hi>That he dares to undertake to defend Aſtrology againſt all the divines in England put together.</hi> But ſuch an expreſſion (if he meant not onely to <hi>dare</hi> but to <hi>do it</hi>) never came out of the mouth of one that was a Scholar indeed, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in his ſober wits, upon any diſpute whatſoever. But if he mean to <hi>dare to undertake it,</hi> but not <hi>to do it.</hi> Then I confeſſe I am brought in part to believe him, by that ſtory of the man, that did <hi>dare to undertake</hi> to take his flight from the top of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Steeple, and to fly; though <hi>he did it not,</hi> but fell down and brake his neck, But I may not forget to ſatisfie the Reader in one thing; how neatly <hi>VV.

                              <p>IT was about the Heart of Summer, (when the Celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Dog belcht from his burning Galls infectious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes to poyſon frail Mortality) that I walked into a Friends Garden of mine, no far diſtant from this ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous (but ſinfull) City, to ſcent the freſh and cool Air, that did breathe on thoſe ſweet-ſmelling flowers. But I no ſooner entred into this <hi>Microcoſm</hi> of ſweetneſs, but the amenity neatneſs, elegance, and ſplendour of the Place did ſo tickle and delight my ſenſes, that I thought it rather a celeſtial Paradiſe, then a terreſtrial Garden.</p>
                              <p>But, as I was wondering at this Place worthy of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, this extaſie of my admiration was broken off by the occaſion of a noiſe I heard not far from me, which at the firſt was but like the ſoft breathing of a winde, ſighing from the pregnant entrails of the Earth, but by degrees it began to reſemble a Tempeſt, ſailing aloft in the Air. When it drew nigher me, I perceived this lowdneſs to be engendred by the ever-moving Tongues of ſome twenty Women, that came talking and walking down an Alley (neighbouring very nigh me) and all of them talking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; ſo that although I had an itching deſire to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and an attentive ear to hear the ſubject of their Diſcourſe, yet it was as poſſible for me to know what they did talk, as to make them leave talking. In the Rere of theſe I perceived an ancient Man (on whoſe head the hand of Age had ſnowed white hairs) come with a grave pace after them; whom I intreated, if it lay within the reach of his knowledge, to reſolve me what the cauſe was ſo many people, and moſt of them Women, ſhould flock together, or what buſineſs they ſhould have in ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and by place as that was, ſo early in the Morning?
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:121621:83"/>This old Father without any pieviſhneſs (which is a paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on incident to Age) firſt ſmiled in my face, then took me by the hand, and began to open the myſtery of their meeting, and his own being there, in this manner.</p>
                              <p>Son, ſaid he (for ſo I may properly call thee, becauſe Smoothneſs and Alacrity, the Characters of Youth, ſit on thy unwrinkled forhead) theſe Women your eyes did lately take notice of, are Creatures ſo ignorantly obſtinate, that neither the milde intreaty of a Friend can perſwade them from their Follies, nor the bad report of an Enemy diſſwade them from their perverſneſs. The party to whom they come, is a Bird, of whoſe kinde I think there are but few living, for he profeſſeth himſelf to be a Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and the cauſe of their coming, is to be reſolved ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Money, Silver-ſpoons, Rings, Gowns, Plate, or Linnen they have loſt; ſome, to know how many Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren they ſhall have; ſome, how many Husbands, and which ſhall love them beſt; others, about other buſineſs; but in general, all of them to know ſomething, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed at laſt comes to nothing. And I my ſelf (like an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-day Fool) have been there at the leaſt half a ſcore times, onely to give my money away, to be laught at. Yet I have words enough; for he will promiſe more then twenty Courtiers, talk more for half a Piece then half a ſcore Lawyers, and lie more then twenty Chronologers: yet with ſome trick or evaſion, he will come clearly off, without being ſuſpected for an Impoſtour, eſpecially if he have ſome man in hand he thinks he dare work on, as he hath done me for example.</p>
                              <p>For going to the Croſs one Sunday morning to hear a Sermon, ſome <hi>Mercurian</hi> and nimble-finger'd Pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocket, that had more minde of my Purſe then the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, gelt it of ſixteen pound; ſo that I went home light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by two Stone then I went out. After I had fretted much, and to no purpoſe, I uſed all the means I could to recover my loſs, as by feeing the Keepers of <hi>Newgate,</hi>
                                 <pb n="159" facs="tcp:121621:83"/>who know which of that Law are appointed to filch in every part of the City; yet ſtill I came home a greater looſer then I went out: for always being in hope to finde that which I loſt, I loſt more, by bribring one Knave to diſcover another. At the laſt, it was my bad fortune to meet with an old Woman, that put a greater confidence in the <hi>Jews Caballs,</hi> and <hi>Thalmud,</hi> the <hi>Shepheards Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar,</hi> and Books of <hi>Palmeſtry,</hi> then any part of the <hi>Bible;</hi> who adviſed me to repair to Doctour <hi>P. C.</hi> in <hi>Moor-fields,</hi> at the upper end of this Alley, and if Art could help me to it again, I ſhould be ſure to hear of it. This draught of good News this old Woman gave me, to quench the thirſt of my deſire, which I drank in at mine ears as greedily as a man ſick of a burning Feaver will the cooleſt Julips: ſo giving this old Piece of Superſtition a <hi>Teſter</hi> for her News, I inſtantly went to Maſter Doctour. Who perceiving me to be one that loved Gold well (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Age moſt commonly is covetous) thought the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to work upon me, as he did; for his Doctourſhip had the Art to hold me in hand three Weeks; in which time, he made the ſixteen pounds I loſt, twenty: and when all came to a period, he told me, that he had laboured hard for me, and at the laſt, by his no ſmall induſtry and pains, had found out the Thief that had my Money, but he was fled into the <hi>Low-countries,</hi> becauſe there were many Warrants out to apprehend him for many Thefts and Burglaries he had committed; and if it pleaſed me to take ſhipping, and ſail thither, I ſhould be ſure to finde him at the <hi>Labour in vain</hi> in <hi>Breda.</hi> But this comfort went as cold to my heart, as the Sentence of Death to a man that ſtands arreigned at the Barr; for I had rather go five thouſand miles by Land, then five miles by Sea, and if it had been a hundred pounds I had loſt, I would rather have given as much more, then hazard my ſelf by Water. Yet howſoever I may doubt, nay truly reſolve my ſelf, that he hath palpably cheated me: yet it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:121621:84"/>to finde him a Lyar, except I meant to take more pains about it, then it was worth. Therefore as patiently as I am able, I am going home again, purpoſing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to take heed of two Pick-pockets; the one the Diver that met with me in <hi>Pauls</hi> Church-yard, the other the Doctour in <hi>Moor-fields,</hi> that robb'd me as well as the firſt, who in my minde hath deſerved, for his artificial Cheating, the Pillory, as well as the other did the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, for Stealing.</p>
                              <p>He no ſooner had delivered me this Relation, but he haſted away from me: therefore ſeeing he was ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate to be gone, I onely ſhewed my ſelf gratefull in thanking him for his kindneſs; ſo he went homewards, and I into my Garden. But now my minde was quite tranſported from the ſweetneſs of that Place, and onely fixt on the ſubtilty of the Doctour, and his politick an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the old man about the recovery of his money; ſo that I could not be at quiet with my ſelf, while I was truly reſolved of the Art of this Star-gazer. Therefore on a morning which was as calm as I could wiſh my thoughts now were, I put on a Sute of courſe Northern Dozens, with all accoutrements that were moſt ſutable to that homelineſs, and with all expeditition went to Maſter Doctour, and haſtily knocking at his Worſhips door, there came running down the ſtairs with a nimble dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (the little <hi>Mephiſtopheles</hi>) his Boy, demanding with whom I would ſpeak; to whom, in a broad <hi>Somerſetſhire</hi> language, I anſwered, With Maſter Doctour, upon an earneſt buſineſs. Upon the delivery of this Meſſage, this young Spirit, like exhaled Dew, nimbly flew away from me, who upon an inſtant, like a flaſh of Lightning, was in my boſome again before I could perceive him; and then, without any more Interrogatories, maſhalled me up into his Maſters Study, who ſate in this manner following:</p>
                              <p>Before a ſquare Table, covered with green Carpet, on which lay a huge Book in <hi>Folio,</hi> wide open, full of ſtrange
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:121621:84"/>Characters, ſuch as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans</hi> were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver guilty of; not far from that a ſilver Wand, a Surplus, a watering Pot, with all the ſuperſtitious or rather feigned Inſtruments of his couſening Art. And to put a fairer co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour on his black and foul Science, on his Head he had a four-corner'd Cap, on his Back a fair Gown (but made of a ſtrange faſhion) on his right hand he held an Aſtrolabe, in his left a Mathematical Glaſs. At the firſt view, there was no man that came to him (if he were of any faſhion) could offer him for his advice leſs then a <hi>Jacobus,</hi> and the meaneſt half a Piece, although he peradventure (rather then have nothing) would be contented with a brace of Two-pences. I no ſooner came into his Study, but I did him the reverence belonging to his Doctourſhip, and ſtood as long bare to him, as a poor Countrey Client that ſues <hi>in formâ Pauperis,</hi> will to his hungry Lawyer. At the laſt, with the expence of many a Leg, and May it pleaſe your Worſhip, I told him that the cauſe of my coming was, that having lately loſt at the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> Bar in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall a Chain of Gold of three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Links, therefore I came to his Doctourſhip, having been informed, that his Art could bring it to light again: ſo putting my hand into my Leather Pouch, I greaſed his ever-dry Palmes with an Angel; who no ſooner had a feeling of my bounty, but he began to be more liberal to me of his Tongue. And while I ſtood leaning on my Staff, he delivered his Emperick-like Oration.</p>
                              <p>Honeſt Friend, the loſs you have ſuſtained,<note place="margin">The <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure. caſters</hi> Oration?</note> is ſo great that I make no doubt, what you now have given, or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhall give, will nor come forced or wrackt from you, but voluntary and free. For it is wiſedom in Man to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture ſmall things to regain greater, where there is a poſſibility of obtaining. He is not worthy of Money, that will not ſeek after it, and he cannot truly judge, how to value ſo precious a Metall as Gold, that is not ſtung with the loſs of it. Therefore Sir, your care deſerves a
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:121621:85"/>redreſs, and this Book (meaning his <hi>Ephemerides</hi>) with my Art and induſtry, ſhall be the inſtrumental Cauſes to make you happy in the recovery of that which is worthy both of my Care and your Coſt. And to put you in ſome hope, if that Man that had your Chain lives either with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Horizon of <hi>England, France, Spain, Italy,</hi> or the <hi>Low-countries,</hi> I will undertake to ſhew you him, and in what place, and what company he is in. There is not a Spirit, either of the Fire, Air, Earth, or Water, but I have at my command as readily as any Gallant hath his Page or Foot-boy: I can conjure them all together, and make them trot up and down the City, leaving not a Pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pockets, Gilts, Lifts, Decoys, or Divers Hoſe unſurveyed.</p>
                              <p>Look here Sir, (with that, he advanced his Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Glaſs) with this Inſtrument, firſt deviſed by that learned Man in our Art, <hi>Hermes Treſmegiſtus,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe called <hi>Mercury,</hi> I can ſee all things done in <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom.</hi> If in the day time I look in it, I will as eaſily ſee what is done in the City, as the Sun. There cannot a withered-faced Lady paint her decayed Countenance at her Chamber-window, and ſet a fair gloſs on it with her <hi>Fucuſſes</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Tinctures, but I ſee her as perfectly as her ſhe Secretary her Chamber-maid. There cannot a Counter-book-keeper and a Conſtable ſhare a poor mans Fees, that the Night before was brought into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (becauſe he would not give the blinking Beadle or beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Watch-man a Teſter) but I ſee it as eaſily as their Fellow, the Bawd-like Door-keeper. There cannot a Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Clerk, that it may be is more Juſtice then his Maſter, take a Bribe of a noted Cut-purſe, whoſe name perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture ſtands at leaſt twenty ſeveral times upon record in <hi>Newgate</hi> Book, but I perceive it as well as the Doxy that brought it him. In the Night-time, if I ſtand with this Inſtrument in in my hand, I can ſee what is done in the City as well as the Man in the Moon. There cannot a Drunkard come reeling out of a Tavern at twelve a clock
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:121621:85"/>at Night, but he is as manifeſt before me, as the Drawer that beat him out of Doors after he had ſpent all his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. I can ſee the commanding Conſtable and the drowſie Watch fit nodding on a Stall, while a company of Roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Boys, <hi>alias</hi> Brothers of the Sword, come by firſt ſwearing them awake, then out of their Authority, who in ſpight of their teeth will crave leave to paſs by them. There cannot a Tradeſmans Puritanical Wife riſe early in a Morning, under the pretence of hearing a Lecture, but I know whether ſhe goes as well as the Fore-man of her Shop that uſhers her. Nay Sir, I have ſeen the Pope go in his <hi>Pontificalibus</hi> with his whole Heard of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals to S. <hi>Peters</hi> Church in <hi>Rome,</hi> as often as any Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen hath ſeen the right honourable the Lord <hi>Mayor</hi> go to <hi>Pauls Croſs</hi> in <hi>London.</hi> As for <hi>Preſter Jack,</hi> the great <hi>Mogul,</hi> the Sophy of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and the great <hi>Turk</hi> I can ſee them as often as <hi>I</hi> do my Boy, that is never from my el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow. And all this is done by <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> by ſacred <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> divine <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> the Art of Arts, the Science of Sciences, for it is the ancient, the moſt authentick, the moſt excellent Art in the World. For old father <hi>Adam</hi> was both an <hi>Astronomer</hi> and <hi>Aſtrologer; Abraham</hi> and all the Patriarks: Nay, <hi>I</hi> will aſture you, the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of our Art have been famous in all Countries; for <hi>Porphyrius</hi> and <hi>Apuleius</hi> derive the Original of <hi>Magick</hi> from the <hi>Perſians,</hi> although <hi>Suidas</hi> will have it from the <hi>Maguſeans,</hi> and from them he cals them <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi;</hi> the <hi>Latins</hi> call us Wiſe-men, the <hi>Grecians,</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers; the <hi>Indians, Gymnoſophiſts;</hi> the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> Prieſts; the <hi>Cabaliſts,</hi> Prophets; the <hi>Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Aſſyrians, Chaldeans;</hi> the <hi>Frenchmen, Bards:</hi> And many excellent and eminen: men have flouriſhed in this Knowledge; as <hi>Zoroaſter</hi> the ſon of <hi>Aromaſius,</hi> who laugh'd when he was born, among the <hi>Perſians; Numa Pompilius,</hi> among the <hi>Romans; The shion,</hi> among the <hi>Gymnoſophiſts; Hermes,</hi> among the <hi>Egyptians; Buda,</hi>
                                 <pb n="164" facs="tcp:121621:86"/>among the <hi>Babylonians; Zamolxis,</hi> among the <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians;</hi> and <hi>Abbaris,</hi> among the <hi>Hyperboreans.</hi> A thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand more beſide theſe, were excellent <hi>Aſtrologers;</hi> as <hi>Ptolomeus,</hi> whom ſome (though very Fools in their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) hold to be the firſt <hi>Aſtronomer</hi> that ever was: then <hi>Meſſahala, Aboafar, Abenragel, Alchibichius, Albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazar, Abraham, Avenezra, Algazel, Hermes Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migiſtus, Aratus, Higinus,</hi> and <hi>Thebit;</hi> after whom, did ariſe <hi>Maternus,</hi> that famous Mathematian: then, <hi>Georgius Purbachius;</hi> after whom followed <hi>Johannes de Monte Regio, Alphonſus</hi> King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> as his Tables can teſtifie. Was not broad-ſhouldered <hi>Atlas,</hi> that was bigger then the great Porter, an admirable <hi>Aſtronomer</hi> and <hi>Aſtrologer?</hi> Was not <hi>Erra Pater</hi> (whom I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt forgot) a rare Fellow at <hi>Aſtronomy?</hi> Yes, as this his Table can teſtifie. What think you Sir, was not this learned Artiſt deeply read in the large-leav'd Book of Heaven? Do not you think he could learnedly diſcourſe of the Poles, Spheres, Orbes, Circumferences, Circles, Centres, Diameters, the Zodiack, the Zenith, the Artick, the Antartick Poles, <hi>Tropicus Capricorni,</hi> and <hi>Tropicus Cancri?</hi> He was as well acquainted with the Twelve Signes in Heaven, as any Tradeſman with thoſe in <hi>Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,</hi> and run over the Nature of the ſeven Planets as nimbly as the <hi>French</hi> Vaulter over the Ropes. And I my ſelf, (but that I know this kinde of Learning is out of your Element) could diſcourſe to you what a ſullen fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Saturn</hi> is, (on whom the permanent continuation of all things depend) what a joviall fellow <hi>Jupiter</hi> (on whom the fecundity of Agent Cauſes rely) what a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling Swaſh-buckler <hi>Mars</hi> (on whom the ſwift expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of any thing to the effect doth hang) what a hot fellow <hi>Sol</hi> (whom all Agent Cauſes follow) what a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Wench <hi>Venus</hi> (on whom the fecundity of all Material Cauſes look after) what a merry fellow <hi>Mercury</hi> (in whom a manifold vertue doth flouriſh) and what a mad
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:121621:86"/>Laſs <hi>Luna</hi> (on whom the increaſe and decreaſe of humane things conſiſt.) For know, that the rich and golden Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt that I have gathered out of the ſweet and fruitfull Fields of many learned mens Works, and carefully hoord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in the Garner of my breaſt, hath made me full and copious in my knowledge; ſo that there is no Art and Science, but I am as deeply and profoundly read in, as thoſe that have taken the Worſhipfull Degree of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour. I am ſo good at Phyſick, that every morning I have whole Troops of mad men, and others, ſick of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pegoes, Gouts, Epilepſies, Feavers,</hi> and many others la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring under as dangerous Diſeaſes as theſe, ſend their Urine to me, ſo that never Doctour was ſo famous: for when Medicine will not prevail, and that neither <hi>Galen, Paracelſus, Avecin, Hyppocrates,</hi> nor all the Heirs of <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> can cure them; I have a Spirit that will fright any Diſeaſe from the moſt dangerous and over-ſpent Patient. My skill in Alchymy is ſo great, that I can turn any thing that is brought to me into as perfect Gold as ever came out of the <hi>Indies.</hi> Frier <hi>Bacon</hi> was an Aſs, Doctour <hi>Fauſtus</hi> a Fool, <hi>Ripley</hi> an Emperick, and <hi>Kelly</hi> a Coxcomb to me; they were not worthy to blow my Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, or look to my Stills, while I work for the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers Stone. But for <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> I can do that none of my Profeſſion beſides my ſelf, could ever reach unto: for there is nothing loſt but I can finde again; nothing in hazard of loſing but I can preſerve ſafe &amp; ſure; I have given Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Spirits, that have kept their Shops as faithfully, as if they had twenty Journeymen continually in it. There is not a part of the Body, but I can give a Spirit to keep it ſafe &amp; ſound. Therefore Sir, to conclude, aſſure your ſelf, that if all my Spirits &amp; mine own endeavours can do you a pleaſure (as you need not doubt of my Art) you ſhal not fail of your Chain: ſo merrily return to your Lodging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and repair to me to morrow morning, 30, Minutes after 6. and always remember to admire at the wonderfull power of ſacred, divine and heavenly <hi>Aſtrology.</hi>

                                 <hi>When he had made an end I gave this Anſwer to the <hi>Figure-caſter,</hi> and the Confutation of it.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>SIr, if you every day ſhould trouble your ſelf, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe that hear you, with theſe long-winded Exerciſes, you had need eat great ſtore of Lycoris: and if you lye ſo much to every man, as you have done to me, you had beſt learn of <hi>Symonides</hi> the Art of Memory; for theſe two things are moſt requiſite for thoſe that talk and lye ſo much as you do. You have made a large Aſtrological diſcourſe, onely to make me a Fool, and prove yourſelf a Knave; for cunningly in your <hi>Exordium</hi> you hearten me on to cheat my ſelf: for doth not a man palpably couſen himſelf, when he gives money to a Knave, that firſt cheats him before his face, then laughs at him behinde his back; which is the true cuſtome of all <hi>Figure-caſters,</hi> of whoſe faculty you profeſs to be.</p>
                              <p>As for your Inſtruments, as your Mathematical Glaſs, with which you can do Wonders, your ſilver Wand, Watering Pot, four-corner'd Cap, are but meer ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Ornaments, either borrowed from the <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> And it is a queſtion, whether the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Preiſts had theſe from the Roguiſh Conjurers, or the Conjurers from them: for juſt ſuch Ceremonies and Exorciſmes the Conjurers uſe upon their invocation of Devils, the Papiſts do in their Invocations; for they exorciſe and conjure their Salt, that it may not loſe the ſavour, and their Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which the ignorant people gape for as greedily as a Raven will for cool air in the midſt of <hi>July,</hi> and this they call Holy Water: then they conjure their Oyl, their Balm, their Herbs, and Plants, that they may have the virtue and influence to heal the ſick and diſeaſed: they conjure their Candles, that they may not burn blue; and Bees, that they proſper, and not ſting any holy or religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Frier, when he dares adventure his bald Crown nigh
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:121621:88"/>one of their Hives. What is the Chriſtening of Bels, Altars, Pilgrimages, Proceſſions, Images, Holy Aſhes, Holy Pace Eggs, Flames, Palmes, and Palm-boughs, Albs, Copes, and Maniples, Veſtiments, Miters, Staves, Fools, and Friers Hoods, Shells, and Bells, Paxes, licking of rotten Bones, creeping to wooden Images and Croſſes, ſhaving of Crowns, and a thouſand of the like Antick Tricks, but flat Sorcery and Witchcraft? And do not all theſe Fooleries agree with the Conjurers Rogueries? Who always obſerve the Time of the Moon before they ſet their Figure; and when they have ſet their Figure, and ſpread their Circle, firſt exorciſe the Wine and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which they ſprinkle on their Circle, then mumble in an unknown Language: Do they not croſs and exorciſe their Surplus, their ſilver Wand, Gown, Cap, and every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument they uſe about their black and damnable Art? Nay, they croſs the place whereon the ſtand, becauſe they think the Devil hath no power to come into it, when they have bleſt it: therefore I cannot be perſwaded, but you had your Ceremonies from the Papiſts, who firſt had them from the <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Pagans,</hi> or they from you, for you both couſen the poor blinded people after one manner; firſt, of their Souls, by drawing them to Superſtition. Secondly, of their Eſtates, by defrauding them of their Money: for which cauſe, both of you have deviſed theſe Ceremonies. Thus much for your Inſtruments. Now for your Authours you pile up on the neck of each other, I hold not lawfull to be ſtudied to an ill intent; and for moſt of them, I hold Atheiſts, and Fellows, whoſe Works ought rather to be burnt, for being ſtuft full of Blaſphemy, then to be read for our inſtruction, or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as hereafter I will ſhew you. As for <hi>Adam, Abraham,</hi> or any of the twelve Patriarks skill in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration, Figure-caſting, or raiſing a Spirit, as you ſay, I am ſure they practiſed none. And for you knowledge in <hi>Aſtronomy,</hi> this is my opinion of you, that you have as
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:121621:89"/>much skill of the Poles in Heaven, as you have of the Poles of <hi>Pauls</hi> Steeple. Your skill in Phyſick ſhall by no means make me (if I chance to fall ſick) chuſe you for my Doctour, except I am weary of my life; for I ſhall be in more danger of Death by taking your Potions, then I ſhall be of the Diſeaſe. But indeed, for a Man that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires preſent Cure, <hi>I</hi> think you are excellent for, becauſe <hi>I</hi> make no doubt, that you will hold him long in hand: and in this you and all other <hi>Medicaſters</hi> and Dog-leaches are happy, becauſe the Sun doth always behold your good ſucceſs, and the Earth covers all your igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances. It is a common ſaying,<note place="margin">Plin. l. <hi>29</hi> c, <hi>1.</hi> Talis Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicus est Dedecus.</note> 
                                 <hi>Nullum medicum eſſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritum niſi triginta homines ad orcum dimiſerit:</hi> That it is impoſſible for any Phyſician to be skilfull, except he hath killed his thirty men. But for your part I dare ſwear, if you ſhould kill three hundred (as it may be it comes ſomething nigh that number, becauſe you have been a long Practitioner) you would ſtill remain but a Quack-ſalving Phyſician; one, that it may be hath ſome little faint glimmering of the Practick, but nothing of the Theory of this moſt learned and deep Art: for being ſo illiterate as you are, how can you, (neither underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin</hi> Tongues, in which the grounds of Phyſick were firſt writ) be ſo famous as you report your ſelf to be? Yet there is one thing in your large Oration, that you would make a Man believe you have ſome skill in Phyſick, becauſe you ſay, that whole Troops of mad men come to you; in this a man may believe you; for if men were not mad, and ſtark out of their wits, they would never come to you for your advice. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing you have ſpoken, that <hi>I</hi> can perſwade my ſelf you have ſaid true, but in this, in profeſſing your ſelf an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymiſt: for <hi>I</hi> dare undertake, that if a man bring you a Cart-load of Braſs, Iron, or Pewter, you can, in the time a man will go either into <hi>Long-lane,</hi> or <hi>Hounds-ditch,</hi> turn it into as good Gold, as is in the richeſt Uſurers cloſe
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:121621:89"/>ſhut Pouch in the City. But for the Philoſophers Stone, <hi>I</hi> think you can finde out the Quadrature of the Circle, or a new way to the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> as ſoon as finde out that: if you can finde it out for others, why cannot you as well for your ſelves? By this a man may perceive the Roguery of all Alchymiſts, and the true nature of their Art, which indeed is an Art without Art, whoſe begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, ſtoutly to lye, and whoſe end is, miſerably to beg. And to conclude, all theſe Gold engendring <hi>Chymiſts,</hi>

Alſo your Spirits for all Trades, and to cure all Diſeaſes, and to defend every part of the Body, is as pretty and queint a Deceit, as that of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion; who will fell any Vocation a Saint, to keep, defend, and proſper it: For they hold, that S. <hi>Hugh</hi> and S. <hi>Euſtace</hi> guard Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from perils and dangers, that the Stag or Buck may not hit them on the Head with their Horns; S. <hi>Martin</hi> and S. <hi>

                              <p>It may-be (Sir) at the firſt you ſuppoſed me to be (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of my plain Countrey Habit) a Woodcock fit for your Sprindge: but to be plain with you Sir, your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is deceived of me, for I can perceive you to be an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Knave; for your Tricks are ſo thin and ſleight, that a man of a very dim underſtanding may ſee clean through
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:121621:90"/>them. Your Diſcourſe is neither knit together with the Nerves of Underſtanding, Wit, Art, Judgement, or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, it hath no reality or eſſence in it: but you huddle a company of Aſtronomical words together, wanting both coherence, method, and congruity; you pour out whole Dictionaries of ſtrange words, talk as though you could repeat <hi>Dutch Gallobelgicus,</hi> or <hi>Engliſh Hollings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> without Book, and lye as if you had held <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> Pen while he writ the Nine Muſes. To tell you true Sir, I came not hither to finde out a Chain (for indeed I have loſt none) but firſt to finde out, then to expreſs your Roguery: therefore I think, if you had been a true Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, it were impoſſible I ſhould put a Trick upon you, that is ſo excellent at the moſt couſening, cheating, and conycatching Art of <hi>Aſtrology.</hi> I perceive by your ſwearing, I am very tedious to you: but good Sir be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, for I have given your Tongue an uncontroulable li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, to ſpeak in the defence of your Art, that hath been ſo beneſicial to you: therefore I hope you will give me leave (if not, I now will be ſo bold as to take it) to ſpeak in the diſpraiſe of it, becauſe it hath been ſo prejudicial to many. If Figure-caſting be an Art, or Science, why is it not a Liberal Science as well as all the other? Or why is it not ſtudied as freely and as lawfully as the reſt, but that the Profeſſour of it is forced to flie into ſuch by-places, dark corners, and Garden-allies as theſe? If you are aſhamed to ſhew the Reaſons, I will not, but truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal them; which are, either becauſe the general eye of the World may not take notice of the foolery of thoſe people, and ſo give them warning, or that the Roguery of you that entice them may not be apparent, and ſo you come to a deſerved puniſhment: Or that you may be thought more famous in the opinion of the ignorant, who ſuppoſe that ſuch melancholly places beſt ſuit with ſuch as ſtudy theſe Arts. This may appear by the cunning Man on the <hi>Bank-ſide,</hi> Mother <hi>Broughton</hi> in <hi>Chick-lane,</hi>

                              <p>Again, there is no Art or Science, but the definition ſhews the excellency of it. <hi>Grammar</hi> is the Science of ſpeaking and writing truly, the Fountain and Original of all Arts. <hi>Logick</hi> the Art of Arts, the Science of Sciences, that makes way for the beginning of all Methodes, and an Art that by diſputing findes out the Truth. <hi>Rhetorick</hi> is an Art teaching to ſpeak elegantly, by Tropes and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures. <hi>Arithmatick</hi> is the Doctrine of Numbers. <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick</hi> the harmonious faculty of weighing the differences of Sounds by ſenſe and Reaſon. <hi>Geometry</hi> the Diſcipline of immoveable Greatneſſes, and the contemplative deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of Forms. <hi>Astronomy</hi> a certain Law and Rule, conſidering the Motion of ſuperiour Bodies. <hi>Philoſophy</hi> the knowledge of Divine and Humane things, joyned with the ſtudy of living well. <hi>Phyſick</hi> the Art of curing and healing the ſick and diſeaſed.</p>
                              <p>But for your <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> your ſacred <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> your divine <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> I never read, that any Divine, Father, or Preacher ever gave any commendable deſcription of it: indeed, ſome of that wiſe Sect you profeſs your ſelf to be of, have endeavoured to illuſtrate and beautifie, with one of whoſe Authority I will not allow of, becauſe Divinity (the Queen and Miſtreſs of the Arts) doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it. Therefore, becauſe there is no true deſcription of this Art, if the Students of it will think themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to me, I will furniſh them with one.</p>

                                    <hi>AStrology is an Art, whereby cunning Knaves cheat plain honeſt men, that teacheth both the Theory and Practick of cloſe Couſenage, a Science inſtructing all the

                                 <p>This is the true Deſcription of your Art. Now the virtue and power of your Art, is to calculate Deaths and Nativities, caſt Figures, finde out things that it may be were never loſt, gives Fools Flies to win if they can at Ordinaries, and more of the like, which I will not nominate, becauſe it will be troubleſome to my ſelf, and tedious to your Doctourſhip (whom I perceive to be as full of Frets, as a Muſician) all which I will prove to be unlawfull, to the diſgrace of all the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and diabolical Students in that Art: and if I do not artificially confute and confound all thoſe that can raiſe a Spirit, and caſt a Figure, and all other <hi>Mountebanks, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perick,</hi> and <hi>Impoſtoſtours,</hi> ſuch as you are that pretend to do it; then let them boldly and confidently ſay, I am but a meer Freſh-man, and no true Maſter in my Art.</p>
                                 <p>Some Principles, conducing to the perfect Science and knowledge of <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> handle the Natures and the Parts of the <hi>Zodiack;</hi> others, the Qualities of the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets;</hi> ſome the Dimenſions and abſtruſe ſignifications of the Houſes. The <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> themſelves divide the <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack</hi> into twelve Parts or Signes, having every part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of thirty Degrees of Longitude, and twelve of Latitude. In theſe pretty Inventions they ſhew themſelves <hi>Poets</hi> as well as <hi>Aſtrologers,</hi> in feigning ſo neatly: for can any of them make me beleive there are twelve Signes to be ſeen in Heaven as viſibly as thoſe on the Earth, or that there are any ſuch Creatures in Heaven, as the crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn'd <hi>Ram,</hi> the goring <hi>Bull,</hi> the poyſon-ſpitting <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,</hi> any lecherous <hi>Crab-fiſh,</hi> unconſcionable <hi>Scales,</hi> roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Lion,</hi> or hot-rained <hi>Goat?</hi> Can any of you make me believe there is ſuch a Wilderneſs of wilde Beaſts as theſe?
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:121621:91"/>it may be indeed there is <hi>Virgo,</hi> becauſe ſhe is ſeldome ſeen on the Earth; but for the angry <hi>Bear,</hi> ſnarling <hi>Dog,</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous <hi>Dragon,</hi> greedy <hi>Vultur,</hi> hiſſing Snake, horrible <hi>Hydra,</hi> fearfull Hare, or Man-loving <hi>Dolphin</hi> to be in Heauen, I never will believe it: howſoever I have heard a plain Countrey fellow ſtand in defence of it, that if there were no ſuch things in <hi>Heaven,</hi> ſuch <hi>wiſe men</hi> as <hi>Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nack-makers</hi> would never put them forth in <hi>Print.</hi> But I will laugh at their ignorance, and ſcoff at all <hi>weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Wizards</hi> with <hi>Bion</hi> the <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> that held thoſe <hi>Aſtronomers</hi> and <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> ridiculous, that cannot ſee Fiſhes ſwim in the Sea, yet affirm they have ſeen them in <hi>Heaven:</hi> Or deride them, as <hi>Diogenes</hi> did.</p>
                                 <p>The ſame <hi>Philoſopher</hi> hearing a <hi>Star-catcher</hi> make a long, and (as he thought) a learned Diſcourſe about the <hi>Celeſtial Signes,</hi> askt him if he ever were there, he knew them ſo well, or ever had any hope to come thither, he did lye ſo much? For is it poſſible (ſaith he) that you can truly know what is in <hi>Heaven,</hi> or what is done there, when in your abſence, you cannot ſee or know what is done at home? But theſe are onely Jeſts put upon them, not Arguments to confute them: but I will prove there are no ſuch things in <hi>Heaven</hi> as theſe they talk, and ſhew the Reaſon why they feign ſuch things to be in <hi>Heaven.</hi>

I have heard of two <hi>Bretbren</hi> that were <hi>Twins;</hi> now there is no <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger</hi> will deny, but that theſe <hi>Brethren</hi> were born un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one <hi>Constellation,</hi> becauſe they were <hi>born</hi> within the ſpace of one <hi>Minute,</hi> and being <hi>born</hi> under a <hi>malevolent Star,</hi> they muſt be both <hi>unfortunate;</hi> and under a <hi>ſmiling</hi> and <hi>luckie Star, happy.</hi> But not long after the <hi>birth</hi> of theſe <hi>Twins,</hi> there was a <hi>Fortune-teller</hi> did <hi>calculate</hi> their <hi>Nativities,</hi> and told the <hi>Parents</hi> of theſe <hi>Children</hi> that they ſhould both be <hi>fortunate,</hi> becauſe he perceived they were <hi>born</hi> under a <hi>fortunate Planet,</hi> which proved contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his <hi>predictions:</hi> for theſe wanting means belike to ſupply their Wants, being come to mens Eſtates, did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome <hi>good Time,</hi> (although they had no <hi>Lands</hi> or <hi>Tenements</hi> of their own) take up other mens <hi>Rents</hi> either on <hi>Newmarket-heath</hi> or <hi>Salisbury-plain;</hi> who for thoſe Facts, to be ſhort, were taken, carried before a <hi>Juſtice,</hi> by him committed to <hi>Priſon,</hi> the next <hi>Sizes</hi> were brought
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:121621:97"/>to their <hi>Triall, convicted, condemned,</hi> and <hi>judged</hi> to be <hi>hanged.</hi> Now all this while their <hi>fortunes</hi> were equal, but contrary to the <hi>prediction</hi> of the <hi>Aſtrologer;</hi> but belike the <hi>Star</hi> that reigned at their <hi>births</hi> had a double <hi>influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> which is contrary to your <hi>Writings,</hi> for when theſe <hi>Brethren</hi> were brought to the place of <hi>Execution,</hi> and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be <hi>turned off,</hi> there came a <hi>Reprieve</hi> for the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, who was carried back again to <hi>priſon,</hi> had his <hi>pardon,</hi> and afterward became an <hi>honeſt man;</hi> but the <hi>eldeſt</hi> with the loſs of his <hi>Life</hi> ſatisfied the <hi>Law.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>There was another <hi>Aſtrologer</hi> did divine, that one <hi>Donello Foroboſco</hi> a notorious <hi>Thief</hi> ſhould be <hi>hanged,</hi> which did come ſomething nigh his <hi>prediction,</hi> for he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a hungry <hi>Lazarello de Tormes,</hi> robb'd <hi>Market-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and <hi>Countrey people</hi> of <hi>Chees-cakes,</hi> and <hi>Butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milk,</hi> for which Fact he was <hi>apprehended</hi> and <hi>condemned</hi> to be <hi>hanged;</hi> ſo coming to the <hi>Gallows,</hi> he ſtudied how he might eſcape that <hi>Destiny;</hi> at the laſt, ſeeing his time, he flung <hi>Ginny-Pepper</hi> in the <hi>Hangman's</hi> eys as he came to put the Nooze over his Neck, lept off the Ladder, and ſhewed himſelf a very nimble Foot-man, for he ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, making toward the Sea, which was nigh the place of <hi>Execution,</hi> and endeavouring to ſwim to ſave himſelf from thoſe that purſued him, the <hi>Cramp</hi> took him in the great <hi>Toe:</hi> and ſo, whereas by the Law of Nations, and the opinion of the <hi>Astrologer</hi> he ſhould have been hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he was moſt unfortunately drowned: and thus theſe learned <hi>Astrologers</hi> were deceived.</p>
                                 <p>It ſtands to great reaſon, that theſe <hi>Artiſts</hi> cannot at all times tell other mens <hi>fortunes,</hi> when they cannot fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell of their own good or bad luck: for there was an <hi>Aſtrologer</hi> made a <hi>prediction</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſevenths <hi>Death,</hi> (but ſome attribute this to <hi>Alphonſus</hi> King of <hi>Arragon</hi>) and that ſhould <hi>die</hi> on ſuch a year. The King hearing of the <hi>South-ſayer,</hi> ſent for him, and askt him if he were an <hi>Aſtrologer,</hi> and could tell <hi>fortunes,</hi> to whom
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:121621:97"/>he anſwered, <hi>Yes.</hi> The King again askt him, if he never did foreſee by his <hi>Art</hi> that there was imminent Danger, that much about that time ſhould hang over his head, meaning the <hi>Aſtrologers,</hi> to whom he anſwered, <hi>No.</hi> Then the King replied, <hi>Thou art a fooliſh Figure-caster, for I am more skilfull then thou art; for as ſoon as I ſaw thee, I inſtantly propheſied thou ſhouldst be in priſon before night, which thou ſhalt finde true:</hi> ſo the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſent him thither. But he had not been long in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody, but the King ſent for him again, to know, if he could caſt a <hi>figure</hi> truly, to know <hi>how long he ſhould be in priſon;</hi> to whom he ſtill anſwered, <hi>No.</hi> Then the King ſaid, <hi>Thou art an illiterate fellow, that neither can fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell of either good or bad luck that ſhall befall thy ſelf; therefor I will conclude, thou canſt not foretell of mine.</hi> So forthwith ſet him at liberty, giving him many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefull words. Yet howſoever theſe <hi>Examples</hi> touch the <hi>Reputation</hi> of thoſe that profeſs your <hi>Art;</hi> yet I will not infallibly ſay, that ſuch things were never done, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be not ordinary to do them; for it is almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible to believe, yet I perſwade my ſelf that it is true what <hi>Zonoras</hi> declareth, that the day before <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apostata</hi> died, a certain man lying in a ſolitary place by himſelf, ſaw a heap of <hi>Stars</hi> in the <hi>Element,</hi> which he ſaid, did expreſs theſe words, <hi>Hodie</hi> Julianus <hi>in</hi> Perſia <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciditur.</hi> That <hi>this day</hi> Julian <hi>the</hi> Apoſtata <hi>is ſlain in Perſia.</hi> And the time being afterwards noted, it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly known that he died that day. But this I take to be an extraordinary <hi>Revelation.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>Another <hi>Aſtrologer</hi> did foretell a <hi>Prelate,</hi> an Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of his, that <hi>he ſhould have a great fall.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Prelate,</hi> that he might be more ſafe (knowing the <hi>Astrologer</hi> to be a learned Man) would never go higher then the loweſt Room of his Houſe; would never dine, or ſup, but ſit on the ground; when he went to Bed, would lie on the ground; hoping by this warineſs, to change the

                                    <hi>poſition</hi> of the <hi>Star</hi> that did threaten him: but it was in vain for a while after News was brought him, that he was <hi>depoſed of his Biſhoprick:</hi> who inſtantly cried out, <hi>Now the Aſtrologers prediction is come to paſs, for indeed I can fall no lower.</hi>

                                    <hi>Byron, Marſhall</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> was told by a <hi>Wizard,</hi> that a <hi>Burgundian</hi> ſhould be the death of him: upon which <hi>prediction</hi> he gave expreſs Command, that <hi>not a man of that Nation ſhould come nigh him:</hi> but all would not help, for he found the <hi>prediction</hi> true, by the <hi>loſs</hi> of his <hi>head,</hi> which a <hi>Burgundian</hi> cut off, that was his <hi>Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner.</hi> Theſe two laſt ſeem to ſavour ſomewhat of the <hi>Devils</hi> ſubtleties, and the <hi>Aſtrologers Amphibologies.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>There was another <hi>Wizard</hi> (as it was reported to me by a learned and rare <hi>Scholar,</hi> as we were diſcourſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Aſtrology</hi>) that ſome tweuty years before his <hi>Death</hi> told <hi>Cuffe</hi> our <hi>Countreyman,</hi> and a moſt excellent <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi> that <hi>he ſhould come to an untimely end:</hi> at which, <hi>Cuffe</hi> laughed, and in a ſcoffing manner intreated the <hi>Astrologer</hi> to ſhew him in what manner he ſhould come to his end: who condiſcended to him, and calling for <hi>Cards,</hi> intreated <hi>Cuffe</hi> to draw out of the <hi>Pack</hi> three, which pleaſed him; who did ſo, and drew three <hi>Knaves:</hi> who (by the <hi>Wizards</hi> direction) laid them on the <hi>Table</hi> again with their <hi>faces</hi> downwards, and then told him, if he deſired to ſee the ſumm of his bad <hi>fortunes</hi> reckoned up, to take up thoſe <hi>Cards,</hi> one after the other, and look on the <hi>inſide of them,</hi> and he ſhould be truly reſolved of his <hi>future fortunes. Cuffe</hi> did as he was preſcribed, and firſt took up the <hi>firſt Card,</hi> and looking on it, he ſaw the <hi>portraiture</hi> of himſelf, <hi>Cap à Pe,</hi> having men compaſſing him about with <hi>Bills</hi> and <hi>Halberds:</hi> then he took up the <hi>ſecond Card,</hi> and there ſaw the <hi>Judge</hi> that ſate upon him: at laſt, he took up the <hi>laſt Card,</hi> and ſaw <hi>Tybourn,</hi> the place of his <hi>Executiou,</hi> and the <hi>hangman,</hi> at which he then laughed heartily; but many years after, being <hi>condemned
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:121621:98"/>for Treaſon,</hi> he rememembred the <hi>fatal prediction</hi> of the <hi>Wizard,</hi> and before his <hi>death</hi> revealed it to ſome of his <hi>friends.</hi> If this be true, it was more then <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> and no better then flat <hi>Sorcery</hi> or <hi>Conjuring,</hi> which is devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</p>
                                 <p>There was another (with whom I will end) that was told by a <hi>Scholar,</hi>
                                    <note place="margin">Anoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</note> that <hi>he ſhould have his brains beaten out:</hi> but he was ſo wary of himſelf, that he would not lie in a Houſe for fear the Roof ſhould fall on his Head, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to lie in a <hi>Tent;</hi> but that Reſolution laſted not long, for he durſt not truſt himſelf there, for fear the great <hi>pole,</hi> that went croſs over it, ſhould knock him on the head: then he reſolved to lie under ſome <hi>Tree,</hi> but then he feared, if he ſhould fall aſleep in a windy night, the <hi>Tree</hi> might fall on him. He durſt not go into any Town, leaſt a Tile ſhould crack his Crown: ſo that what place ſoever he went into, he ſtill was very wary of himſelf. At the laſt, as he was walking in a hot Summers day in the Fields, he was forced to put off his Hat, and having a <hi>bald head,</hi> a ſtrange <hi>bird</hi> that was in the <hi>Element</hi> having an <hi>Oiſter</hi> in her <hi>Claw,</hi> thinking it to be ſome <hi>white Stone,</hi> let it fall on his <hi>head,</hi> and ſo beat out his <hi>brains.</hi> Thus for all his care and providence, he came to his <hi>untimely end,</hi> and fulfilled the <hi>prediction</hi> of the <hi>Aſtrologer,</hi> or rather <hi>Conjurer,</hi> if the <hi>Tale</hi> be true, which I ſcarce believe.</p>

For they ſay, that <hi>if any man, being doubtfull of any thing, doth with a natural motion and radical intention ask them any thing, that then they can reſolve them of any Queſtion they ask.</hi> Now if they miſs, and cannot anſwer directly and truly to what was propounded to them, then they ſay, that he that askt that Queſtion, did it not with any natural moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or any firm or radical intention to be reſolved, but onely to try their <hi>Art.</hi> Thus oftentimes they deceive, and are deceived in their Anſwers; not by the defect that is in their <hi>Art,</hi> but by the levity of him that did ask the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and thus they excuſe themſelves: which are meer Tricks for Evaſion, and haue no ground at all from Reaſon.</p>

If this be true which they hold, that <hi>it is good to ſow Corn under ſuch a tuckie Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation,</hi> what is the reaſon then, that after the Corn that is ſcattered on the Earth by the laborious hands of the <hi>Husbandman,</hi> that after ſo much Grain is come up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, look green together, ripen together, and fit for the Sickle, that ſome of it is blaſted, ſome quite choak'd up, ſome devoured by <hi>Birds,</hi> ſome by <hi>Beasts,</hi> ſome trodden down, and ſome of the Ears pluck from their ſtalks by men that come by that Field they grow in?

                                 <p>But I will now let theſe things paſs (becauſe I make no doubt but I have ſtrongly confuted them) and come to the laſt, but the wicked part of <hi>Astrology;</hi> which concerns the making of <hi>Aſtrological Images,</hi> and to what purpoſe they are made: where I will ſhew, they have no force or virtue from any <hi>Star</hi> or <hi>Conſtellation,</hi> but that the <hi>Devil</hi> worketh about them, and in them, cauſing them to be made under a <hi>Conſtellation,</hi> that the impiety of their <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi> may the more ſecretly be hid.</p>

                                 <p>THe <hi>Fabrick</hi> of <hi>Aſtrological images</hi> are made under a certain <hi>Conſtellation,</hi> either to avoid hurtfull things, or to intice profitable things, for to divers uſes they are made.

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:121621:102"/>muſt carve the Figure of ſome <hi>Scorpion</hi> either in Stone, Wood, or Iron, under ſome convenient Conſtellation, and inſcribe on it an effectual Name, ſignifying the Name of the thing that is to be avoided, and the Name of the <hi>Sign aſcending,</hi> and of the like in divers parts of the <hi>image,</hi> with many other Obſervations, which for brevity ſake I will now let paſs. For a contrary effect, you muſt have a contrary Conſtellation, and a contrary Operation, as in the like <hi>images,</hi> pertaining to <hi>Love, Enmity, Health,</hi> or the like. And although there are many Effects cauſed by theſe <hi>images,</hi> as experience teacheth us,<note place="margin">Non vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginis ſed operatio daemonis producit effectum.</note> yet they are miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably deceived, that think it done by the virtue of any Conſtellation, when it is done by the meer operation of the <hi>Devil:</hi> For not the virtue of the <hi>image,</hi> but the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>Devil,</hi> worketh the Effect. And learned <hi>Averrois</hi> writing againſt <hi>Algazel</hi> the <hi>Aſtrologer,</hi> ſaith, that <hi>theſe images have no virtue from the Stars, becauſe artificial things are not capable of any influence, neither are they any cauſe of a natural operation: for Quality is in the Predicament of Actio.</hi> An <hi>image</hi> therefore made of any earthly ſubſtance, is nothing but a maſſie <hi>Effigies,</hi> and capable of no Action. And in like manner, thoſe <hi>images</hi> that are buried in the midſt of the place where their Operations are expected, are contrary to natural Reaſon. And other things that are obſerved in them, ſhew as great vanity: as, when ſome mens Names muſt be with the left hand, ſome with the right; ſome <hi>images</hi> muſt be buried with their faces upwards, ſome with their feet upwards: which are all ſignes rather of a <hi>Compact</hi> with the <hi>Devil,</hi> then any other natural cauſe; as in the <hi>Negro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick images</hi> of <hi>Angels,</hi> or rather of their <hi>inſcription</hi> of <hi>Devils,</hi> and other unknown <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Characters.</hi> Alſo, the uſe of their <hi>Suffumigations</hi> and <hi>invocations</hi> are ſignes of a <hi>Compact</hi> and <hi>League</hi> with the <hi>Devil.</hi>

And the <hi>image</hi> of <hi>Alber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Magnus</hi> was to be wondered at, which he made in the full and perfect ſhape of a Man, who with the <hi>wheels</hi> and other <hi>Engines</hi> that he had cunningly and artificially wrought in it, made it ſpeak and pronounce words as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, as if they did proceed from a Man indued with Senſe and Reaſon. This Statue, when <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> was ſent into his Chamber, where it lay hid. heard it ſpeak very articulately; which when he heard, then looking for it, and finding it, and viewing it very ſeriouſly, at laſt ſtruck it with a Club, and brake it all to pieces. Which when <hi>Albertus</hi> heard and ſaw, he cried out, and ſaid; <hi>Thomas,</hi> thou haſt deſtroyed the Work of thirty years la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and pains.

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:121621:106"/>Anſwer of the Oracle, the Sophiſter went away laughing, becauſe it promiſed him to finde a Horſe he never loſt.

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:121621:107"/>or Silver, and we chance to finde it inſtantly, to affirm with many old Women that all Dreams are true, for this is but a Trick of the <hi>Devil</hi> to bring us into <hi>Superſtition:</hi> which Trick is not much unlike that he hath put upon the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> making them believe that at the ſight of the <hi>Croſs</hi> he cannot be quiet, but muſt flie away from it; but there is no true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> will think that the <hi>Devil</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of a piece of Wood, Gold, or Silver, but flies from the <hi>Croſs</hi> of purpoſe to draw them into the <hi>Superſtition</hi> of adoring the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and kneeling to it in ſtead of ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him that once hung on the <hi>Croſs:</hi> for although it be a <hi>Croſs,</hi> yet it hath no more virtue and influence in it then when it was a piece of Wood, Stone, or Silver. Thus then you ſee we muſt truſt to no Dreams, except they come by the inſpiration of God and the Holy Ghoſt; of which God ſpake in the 12. of <hi>Numbers.

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:121621:109"/>hand; then it is called <hi>Chyromancy.</hi> This Art many old Women are learnedly experienced in, and will tell any Man or Woman, for meat, drink, or money, what ſhall befall them. If they foretell of any thing that ſhall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by the ſignes they ſee in the ſhoulder-blades of Beaſts, then it is called <hi>Spatalmancia.</hi> There is alſo another kinde of <hi>divination,</hi> which is by Lots: which Lots are made, by drawing out points of an uncertain number, with their Faces turned towards the Moon, with other Obſervations to as little purpoſe as this. The <hi>Dutchmen</hi> are very skilfull at this, and have couſened the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of infinite Maſſes of Money, by their ſelling of Papers; ſo that there was not one among forty, though he came ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo merry to the Lottery, but he ſhould be ſure to go away Blank. Thus Sir, have I laid forth the Brood of divination; now I will come to the Obſervations. It is a diſputable Queſtion, whether by words or deeds the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil will be compelled by <hi>Negromancers,</hi> or whether being called by them, they come, becauſe of ſome League that is between them? If Devils appear, forced by <hi>Negro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick witchcrafts,</hi> why do not <hi>Negromancers</hi> make them come againſt their wills? which ſure they cannot; which is a ſign, that there is a League and Covenant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded between the Devil &amp; Conjurers either manifeſt or occult, why elſe do <hi>Negromancers</hi> dedicate their Books to the chief Devils, whoſe Name they often uſe, but onely to make a Covenant with the Devil, that when they call them by thoſe Names, Charmes, Characters, Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſmes, and the like, they may appear themſelves, or ſend ſome of their inferiour Devils as ſoon as they hear them. Theſe then are approved ſignes and marks of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: and that the Spirits may ſhew themſelves to have a geater power, ſometimes they ſeem very unwilling to come, either becauſe they would make the inchanter more zealous, or that he may delude ſimple people: <hi>for he is a Lyar, and the Father of Lyes.</hi> And now I hope it will
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:121621:109"/>not be impertinent to confute the Opinion of many, who will not believe, that there are any devils but thoſe that are in Hell: but I am perſwaded, that in every corner there is a Spirit. I proceed a little further, to ſhew, why under a certain Conſtellation at certain times. and in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain terrible places, Apparitions appear rather to Women and Children, rather then to Men. Such matters as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurers uſe, do not compell Devils, but rather are ſignes of a League compacted between them. For as S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>The devils take their habitations in bodies, that God, not themſelves, created; and are delighted in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bodies for variety ſake, not as creatures with Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but as ſpirits with ſignes, which ſignes are delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in variety; as ſometimes by Stones, Herbs, Wood, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures, Verſes, and Rites; and men are often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with theſe things.</hi> Which the Devil perceiving, ſeduce them either by ſubtle or crafty means, or by Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, in fawning and Friend-ſeeming ſhews, or beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and amiable ſhapes; as they have appeared to ſome men in the Forms of <hi>Lamiae,</hi> which are but meer <hi>Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſma's</hi> of fair women appearing in that beautious ſhape, feigning themſelves to be in love with young men, who have been ſo often converſant with them, that at the laſt they have brought them to deſtruction. But I think there are few <hi>Lamiae</hi> in theſe days appear, except they be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial ones, which are Whores, who well may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to theſe midnight deluſions; For they will profeſs love, and never leave a man, while they have brought him to ſome Hoſpitall. Neither could the Devil do theſe things, but that he prieth into the heart of man, and then feeds them with that which moſt delights them. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquin</hi> teacheth, that by theſe corporal things they can the more eaſily bring to effect that to which they are called, and they deſire this, that their Art might be held more admirable: and for this caſe, being called under any Conſtellation, they rather will appear, But why to Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:121621:110"/>Children, and ſuch weak Creatures do ſuch Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances ſhew themſelves more then to others, but that they may bring them into an opinion of their Divinity, and that preſtigious Witchcrafts and deluſions may ſooneſt tempt them that have the weakeſt Faith? And to make them afraid, they appear in the Night, as it were in hollow Caves and Caverns of the Earth, Deſarts, dark and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Chambers, whereby the fear of theſe melancholly places, and the unſeaſonable time of the appearance of the Devil, may the more terrifie them. Thus the policy of the Devil ſtill works on the weakeſt and ſillieſt kinde of people.<note place="margin">Avec. <hi>6.</hi> de Nat.</note> 
                                    <hi>Avecin</hi> ſhews how the Senſes may be deluded. The general means is this; <hi>Spirits work nothing</hi> extra nos, <hi>without us; for it is eaſie for Spirits to make many bodies of the Air, which earthly bodies may wonder at.</hi> For <hi>Eraſmus</hi> reports a pretty piece of <hi>Magick</hi> performed by a <hi>Roman</hi> Prieſt (who had it not out of any place of the <hi>Scripture</hi> I am ſure) that invited a company of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to a Banquet,<note place="margin">In Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureo.</note> bidding them bring good ſtomacks with them. The Ladies came, were welcommed by him, entertained by delicate Muſick, and were ſeated at the laſt at the Table according to their Births. There were ſuch variety of rare and ſtrange Diſhes, that they thought that others, not their own Nation, did furniſh their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: they eat well, drunk well, and were merry; and which is better then a piece of Cheeſe, Pippins, or Carro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, to cloſe up the mouth of the ſtomack after Supper, they were welcome. When this Feaſt, rather this Faſt was ended, and (which is not very uſuall with Courtiers) Grace being ſaid, they rendred the Prieſt hearty Thanks for their Banquet, and went home. But they had not been there at the moſt half an hour, but their ſtomacks began to call upon them for meat, for they were all as hungry as if they had eat nothing at the Banquet: therefore did much wonder at themſelves, that they ſhould have ſuch a great deſire to meat, ſeeing they did but newly come from
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:121621:110"/>ſuch a royal Entertainment. But this queint deluſion the Prieſt afterward revealed to them: For although he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited them to a Feaſt, yet they had never a bit of meat; For his Art did delude both the Eye, that thought it ſaw ſuch things, and the Pallat, that ſeemed to taſte thoſe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates. I my ſelf have ſeen a Fellow, that would make people believe, that they ſaw <hi>Orange trees</hi> ſpring out of his <hi>Forehead,</hi> having Birds ſit and ſing on the Boughs, which in an inſtant would vaniſh away again. This Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low was at <hi>Cambridge</hi> drinking at the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> and made a <hi>Drawer</hi> that fill'd him bad <hi>Wine,</hi> believe, that <hi>he would geld him, if he would not bring him of the best Claret in the Cellar:</hi> which the Drawer laugh'd at, and the more to croſs him, fetch of the worſt he could finde. This Juggler ſwore <hi>he would be even with him before it be long;</hi> but the Drawer went away laughing, bidding him <hi>do his worſt.</hi> But the Conceit came at the laſt, like a Jeſt in the laſt Lines of an <hi>Epigram;</hi> for when the Drawer leſt thought of it, as he was running down ſtairs to fetch Wine, he felt ſomething trickle down his Thighes, at the firſt thinking it had been ſome Wine he had ſpilt on his Breeches, but put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Hands into his Hoſe, he pull'd them out bloudy again; ſo that he came running up ſtairs, and with a wide mouth came roaring into the Room where we were drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, crying, <hi>the lame man had gelt him, and that he was utterly undone.</hi> At the firſt this <hi>Vox exclamantis</hi> did beget ſuch a Laughter in us, that we were not able to ſpeak to him; but yet at the laſt, by giving the Fellow good words, and good Wine, he made him a perfect man again.

Why not as well as the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> that were turned into Wolves? Why may not there be a tranſmutation in theſe incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall ſpirits, as in theſe terreſtriall bodies? And why may not there be as ſtrange <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi> in theſe dayes, as there was in the dayes of <hi>Ovid</hi> and <hi>Varro?</hi> nay I will ſtand to it, that in theſe dayes there are as marvellous changes and more true, for I have known a Gallant that at the age of fiveteen, hath been a pregnant witty youth, but before twenty he hath been turned into a right <hi>Aſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nego.</hi> There have been many Citizens that have been very
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:121621:111"/>handſome perſonable men in the morning, who before the Exchange hath been done, have been turned into monſtrous beaſts. There are many tradeſmen that at their firſt ſetting up have been very honeſt men, but after the third or fourth breaking, have been turnd into moſt fearful Sergeants. I have known many that have been accounted wiſe fellows in the Univerſity, that have no ſooner peept into the Temples, or one of the Innes of Court, but have been transformed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to monſtrous Aſſes. Then ſeeing there is ſuch a tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in earthly bodies, why ſhould we think it ſo ſtrange and rare in incorporeall ſpirits? Yet theſe and the like are not recited as if they were true, but to ſhew how the ſenſes may be deluded. and the like may appear by thoſe women that oftentimes are perſwaded that they are riding on the backs of beaſts. Yet for all this, I will not grant there is any virtue in the words or charms of a Negromancer to raiſe up theſe forms. Alſo there is no virtue in thoſe cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall Exorciſms, with which Prieſts exorciſe Wine, Salt, Water, and the like, which I will manifeſtly ſhew you. Firſt, in reſpect of the Matter, for the Matter is but Aire, or Water, or Ink; which can have no virtue in them, for by that reaſon, every ſubſtance of the like kind ſhould have the ſame virtue. Secondly, in reſpect of the Accidentall Form, which is nothing elſe but a configuration of divers Characters, either in writing or ſpeaking, for Phyloſophy teacheth that Accidentall forms have no Action of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Thirdly, in reſpect of the thing ſignified, as the word fire to burn this paper, or the word Death to kill this Man, or the word God, to ſave this Soul, or to raiſe up any dead body; which cannot be: for the name of God cannot do it. But God muſt be invocated by true Faith, whereby he is often pleaſed to grant our requeſts. But Conjurers and Aſtrologers uſe the name of God in another kind, and other Ceremonies, which rather drive away divine Grace and Virtue then procure it, and ſo much the more they ſin, by how much the more they take
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:121621:112"/>the name of God in vain, and to the worſhip of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill. Therefore to conclude this Treatiſe of Divination, I will prove both by the Divine, Imperiall, and Canon Law, that it is not lawfull to be uſed.</p>
                                 <p>The Divine Law ſaith: <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſuffer ſuch Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactours to live.</hi> A man or a woman in whom the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Divination is found, let them dye the death: Let them be ſtoned to death, and let their bloods be upon their own heads. Alſo the Holy Ghoſt in another place ſaith: Let that Soul that is inclined to Southſayers be ſlain in the midſt of the people. The Imperiall Law commands, that they ſhould be beheaded, or be put to any kind of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Judge ſhall think moſt convenient and fitting.</p>

Sure he will not; but admit ſome are, yet will he not affirm they are therefore born in the ſame inſtant of time; I will appeal to any one of diſcretion and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in ſuch matters, if it hold with reaſon, that two Children ſhould be <hi>born both together;</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and to make it more clear, that all Twins are not conceived at one and the ſame inſtant of time, I refer him to the peruſal of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi>

                     <hi>Pliny, Cardanus, Dodoneus, &amp;c.</hi> But let me ask him what he thinketh of the Story of <hi>Proconeſia,</hi> who as the ſtory goes, lying with her Maſter, and his Man her Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant, both in one day; conceived by both,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and brought forth one Childe like the Maſter, and the other like the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:121621:113"/>Man. Wherefore the firſt part of his Argument is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable; neither (upon good conſideration) will his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> for he confeſſes himſelf that the neareſt time of their Birth is, in the ſame hour or leſs, when all that knows any thing in Aſtrology, knows that four mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes of time in the Birth, gives near upon a years time in directions; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> wherefore certainly when he made ſuch clear experience in the Birth of Twins, they were not born in the ſame inſtant, but at leaſt four and four and four mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes difference, for the neareſt time he confeſſes, may be <hi>ſomewhat leſs then an hour;</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> which certainly muſt breed very much difference indeed; wherefore except he could have proved that they were born both at an inſtant, or give us an example of any ſuch that he hath made <hi>clear experience of,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> his Argument and Reaſon is a meer <hi>ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical</hi> Cavil. And whereas he alleadgeth, that <hi>Pharez</hi> and <hi>Zara</hi> did put forth themſelves interchangeably in one hour; but how he can prove it was in one hour, is I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve too hard a Task for him to do, he having no War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant therefore, from the Word of God. But all this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the point, for though <hi>Zarah</hi> put forth his hand firſt, and for diſtinction had a red Thread tied about it, yet he plucked it back again, and <hi>Pharez</hi> was born before him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 38. <hi>v.</hi> 29. He brings the Example of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> to condemn Aſtrology,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> which is far weaker: For all that is acquainted with that ſtory in the Scripture, knows that <hi>Eſau</hi> was born firſt, and after him came his Brother <hi>Jacob;</hi> and that this is clear, the Scripture fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaith, <hi>The Younger ſhall ſerve the Elder, Ergo,</hi> they were not born at one inſtant of time, and therefore I may very well conclude, that this Cavil ſerveth no whit to the condemnation of Aſtrology; ſince for ought he can prove to the contrary, (or any one can tell) they were born ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hours diſtant, and ſo conſequently they muſt needs have ſeverall Significatours at their Birth, which will cauſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much diverſity of manners, fortunes, form, and ſhape,

                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if he will tell me there was ſo ſmall difference in the time, as that <hi>Jacob</hi> had hold on his Brothers heel; I ſay, that yet notwithſtanding, doth this prove them to be born at one and the ſame time; but that there was ſo much time betwixt their Births, as may cauſe much difference in moſt matters of their Lives: but admit this Objection, any underſtanding man knows it could no wiſe ſtand ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſafety of the Mother or Childe, that he ſhould be thus born with one hand before all the body. And again, ſince it is no wiſe poſſible in nature, that Twins ſhould be born both at the ſame inſtant of time; this his frivolous Cavil is of no uſe, unfitly brought for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in queſtion; and altogether inconſiſtent with reaſon.</p>
                  <p>But this by the way; we come to his example of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> which he ſaith, by reaſon of their Differences, confuteth <hi>Aſtrology:</hi> but if he could prove all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference that poſſibly could be imagined, yet is not this a ſufficient ground for him to condemn <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> ſith it hath nothing to do with <hi>Divine providence,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> or matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the <hi>common courſe of Nature;</hi> which may evidently appear, that this Birth of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> is, by the ſtory of their Conception, which you may ſee was abſolutely a thing beyond the power of Nature; for their Mother <hi>Rebecca</hi> (the Scripture telleth us) was barren: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this being ſo, this I ſay alone, is enough to ſilence all that he can ſay againſt <hi>Aſtrology,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> by this Example of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau.</hi> But ſure, notwithſtanding, if one ſhould particularly examine their lives, one ſhould <hi>hardly finde ſuch great difference</hi> between them as could juſtly be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead ged to condemn Aſtrology; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="N"/> for if we look to their <hi>qualities,</hi> they were both <hi>Princes,</hi> if to the number of their <hi>Wives</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> look into the Antiquities of the <hi>Jews,</hi> viz. <hi>Philo,</hi> and you will finde their Children were alike in number <hi>within one,</hi> and we know that <hi>Jacob</hi> had <hi>Leah, Rachel, Billa,</hi> and <hi>Zilpah,</hi> to his Wives, four: and <hi>Eſan, Bathſhemah, Mahalah, Adah,</hi> and <hi>Aholiba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,</hi>
                     <pb n="220" facs="tcp:121621:114"/>four: alſo, if we again look to their <hi>Riches</hi> or Wealth,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="O"/> they were both ſo abundantly wealthy, as that <hi>one Country was not able to contain them both:</hi> but if any one ſay, they differed in the matter of their <hi>birth-right:</hi> I anſwer,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="P"/> that this ſimple Objection is of no validity; for, <hi>Aſtrology</hi> is not to decide or premonſtrate, or foreknow the cauſe of Divine matters, <hi>neither the ſecret will</hi> of God, which that this was Gods ſecret will, there is none but knows; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Q"/> for, as he was choſen to be the root or founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God's people; ſo by the obtaining of the birth-right of his Brother, did clearly premonſtrate, both this his Election, and the power of his Seed, to exceed the power of the others Seed, being the Elder: And here I may alſo add, <hi>they were both roots and foundations of two great Nations:</hi> but as this maketh neither <hi>for,</hi> nor <hi>againſt Aſtrology, It may be</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they will reade us a Lecture of difference from magnitudes and motions,</hi> which Anſwer I muſt confeſs ſutes juſt well enough with the Queſtion,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="R"/> neither of them both being fully to any purpoſe; but to be farther ſatisfied herein, let him look <hi>Ptolomy, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. of his <hi>Quadripartite,</hi> where he ſhall be clearly taught the Reaſons of Differences in Twins, and convinced of his erroneous Cavil, that they are born at the ſame inſtant of time; it is not from magnitudes or motions, though ſomewhat might be ſaid thereon, and that ſo much, as that I believe would trouble him to anſwer; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="S"/> but let that paſs, and hear how he queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and anſwers for and againſt <hi>Aſtrology, if ſo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> be leſs then the Earth according to</hi> Kecker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>at leaſt twenty times, and the reſt of the Planets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ☉, as ♀ twenty ſeven times leſs then the Earth, and ☿ twenty two times, how then ſhall theſe at any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, at one and the ſame time effect or ſignifie any thing to all the world?</hi> It is the opinion indeed (and with very much reaſon) of all the <hi>Mathematicians</hi> and <hi>Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> that ever writ, that theſe three Planets under the <hi>Sun</hi>
                     <pb n="221" facs="tcp:121621:114"/>are leſs then the Earth, but amongſt the moſt learned of them there is much diſpute of the certain magnitude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; but how equivalent this Quirk is againſt <hi>Astrology</hi> is wonderfull! A Candle is not able to give light to a Bowl,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="T"/> or any thing as big as a Peck, becauſe it is ſo much bigger then the Candle; when we know and commonly ſee that it will give light to a great ſpacious Room, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times bigger then it ſelf; we know and ſee, that the influence of a Planet extends it ſelf ten thouſand times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its viſible light to our ſight; but to come cloſer to the matter, hath not the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, ☿ and ♀, their ⚹, <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g>, <g ref="char:trine">△</g> 
                     <hi>dexter</hi> and <hi>ſiniſter,</hi> and ☌, to all and every part or ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt parts of the Heavens (that are millions of times bigger then both them and the Earth) according to their ſeverall motions? And hath not theſe Aſpects as much power and influence, as a perpendicular ☌? and whereas he asketh, <hi>what is the difference of Natures in Twins? when the ſuperiour Planets are proportionably bigger then the Earth,</hi> but ſure he never read that part of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> which I before cited, concerning the ſeverall Significatours in Twins, which is the onely cauſe and reaſon that can be given for his frivolous Quirk: but as he queſtions to bring his bald Arguments about, ſo he anſwers his own Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in hopes to confirm them; <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>this is becauſe of the ſwift external violent motion of the Stars; why then I again demand how the Stars can have time to make any diſtinct impreſſion by any particular influence on one born, eſpecially on one who perhaps may lie in the mouth of the womb partly born, partly unborn; for a quarter or half an hour, or many hours; when the motion of the Zodiack is ſixty times ſixty miles in an hour, which is ſixty miles compleat in one minute.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to anſwer to this weak Cavil, I ſhall ſay no more, but that though the Heavens be ſo ſwift, yet in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of us it is not ſo much as an inch is to ten thouſand Miles; for we ſee by daily experience, that the ☉ (who is
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:121621:115"/>alſo by the ſame violence (contrary to his own natural courſe) carried in like manner) doth not as to us move at all in two or three hours; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> for mark how ſmall a thing in a Diall gives this ſixty Miles in a minute; ſo that this doth no whit at all hinder the influence of the Stars, if they ſhould be hurried ten times ſwifter; for this great courſe is in relation to the circumference of the Heavens, not of the Earth: beſides we know that thoſe Signes that are of longer aſcenſions, as are ♋, ♌, ♍, ♎, ♏, ♐, are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an hour and a half, nay, perhaps two hours aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or in the firſt Houſe, and ſo conſequently may be in any Houſe.</p>
                  <p>And for his <hi>long continuance of the Infant in the mouth of the womb,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">VV</note> this may ſomewhat refell, but there is no Aſtrologer that will take that part of a Birth, or the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Mothers Travell, to be the Ground or <hi>Radix</hi> of the Infants <hi>Nativity;</hi> but that <hi>inſtant</hi> in which He or She is <hi>perfectly ſeperated from the womb, and entred the elementary world,</hi> ſince no man can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly call that a Birth, which is but half expelled, or but half perfected, when alſo ſometimes the Infant may draw back again.</p>
                  <p>Saith he, <hi>If Aſtrologers will plead any thing to help themſelves herein from the ſlowneſs of other motions of the Stars, that are natural to them,</hi> viz. <hi>that the fixed Stars, move with ſo ſlow a motion from North to South back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as that their courſes are not finiſhed in leſs then ſeven thouſand years;</hi> Now I would very fain know of any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional man, how this Anſwer of his in the behalf of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers, is able to avail them a ruſh, or himſelf in his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> ſince they are alſo hurried with the like violence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, every twenty four hours once about the Earth? But as all theſe his Quirks are brought into his advantage (as he thinks,) ſo the advantage he ſtrives to gain hereby, he may brag of, as much as of the former; for all this his gain is but the opportunity of this Queſtion, <hi>viz. How
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:121621:115"/>then can any age ſince the beginning of the world have experience, what the conjunction of the Stars may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce?</hi> This is a great Conqueſt indeed, but how ſlender an Artiſt he herein renders himſelf, let the judicious judge, ſince it is moſt certain that theſe ſtars we call fixed, <hi>move not at all; Ergo,</hi> are nominated fixed, for they move unanimouſly together in their ſphere, which is about ſeven thouſand years finiſhing its courſe, <hi>not the Stars;</hi> but ſuppoſe they do move, yet they move not by ſeveral motions, as the one being ſlower or ſwifter then another, for they are all alike diſtant each from other continually, and if theſe come not to aſpect nor conjunction of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets; yet the <hi>Planets come to configuration with them,</hi> as <hi>Saturn</hi> commeth in configuration of them once in 29. years ſome odd moneths and dayes; <hi>Jupiter</hi> in twelve years, <hi>Mars</hi> in three years, <hi>Sol</hi> in one year or twelve moneths, <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> in the like time or there abouts, the <hi>Moon</hi> in twenty eight dayes and ſome odd houres. I hope then <hi>this experience</hi> may be learned in a far ſhorter time then ſeven or eight thouſand years; and ſince theſe is ſo apparently and vulgarly known, it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground for any one to take the exact poſition of the heavens, either in Twinns births or any others, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the errour that theſe motions he ſpeaketh of can cauſe, which indeed is none at all.</p>
                  <p>SURVEY. The annexing of the <hi>Doctours</hi> ſecond Argument will be a ſufficient reply to theſe extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of <hi>Will. Ramſey.</hi> The <hi>Doctours</hi> ſecond Argument was word for word, thus.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Argument is from cleer experience of Twins conceived at the ſame <hi>inſtant,</hi> and born in the ſame <hi>houre,</hi> or leſſe, and it may be, put forth themſelves in part, at the womb interchangeably in that houre, (as <hi>Pharez.</hi> and <hi>Zara</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 38.) yet before God put any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence by any inward change by grace, the Twinns may be
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:121621:116"/>of an apparent vaſt difference of complexion as we ſee in <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau.</hi> And <hi>experience</hi> knowes of other Twins, either both naturall or both ſpirituall, that far different events in the world have befallen them. Where then is the certainty of Star-predictions? Where is the verity of Aſtrology? It may be they will reade us a lecture of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from magnitudes and motions of Stars; that ſome are bigger then the earth ſome leſſer; again, that ſome fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſome motions in 24. hours; others not other moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in ſo many ſcores of years, or more. But if this be their defence, the matter of predicting Aſtrology is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made to be more incredible. For if (as they ſay with <hi>Keckerman</hi>) the Moon be leſſe then the earth, at leaſt twenty times, and the reſt of the Planets below the Sunne proportionably, as <hi>Venus</hi> twenty ſeven times leſſe then the earth, and <hi>Mercury</hi> twenty two; how then ſhall theſe at any poſture, at any one and the ſame time, effect or ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie any thing to all the world? For all the Aſtrologers in the World will undertake to prognoſticate from theſe Planets upon all men on Earth, born at one and the ſame houre. If the Sunne as they confeſſe, be about an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty times bigger then the Earth; and all the Planets above the Sun proportionably; as that <hi>Saturn</hi> is fourſcore and eleven times bigger then the Earth; <hi>Jupiter</hi> fourſcore and fifteen times; <hi>Mars</hi> one time bigger, with one third; how then is it that there is difference of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and events in thouſands born at the ſame hour, and eſpecially n Twins, as we ſaid afore. If they ſay that this is becauſe of the ſwift externall violent motion of all the Stars <hi>Planets,</hi> and <hi>Fixed;</hi> that they are hurryed round the Earth by the firſt moveable from Eaſt to Weſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in twenty four hours; which is to run ſixty times ſixty miles in every houre, then we demand how can the Stars have time to make any diſtinct impreſſion by any particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on one houre, cſpecially on one who perhaps may lie in the mouth of the womb, partly born, partly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:121621:116"/>ſometimes in the head and foreparts, ſometimes in the hinder parts, for a quarter or half an houre, or many hours. Or what Aſtrologer upon the ſwiftneſſe of thoſe motions, and the ſlowneſſe of the birth, which cannot be born in an inſtant, but at beſt gradually, ſhall be able to prognoſticate punctually that ſuch Stars, with ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flnence, did ſo complexionate ſuch an Infant at ſuch a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute</hi> of time? For by the computation aforeſaid, the Stars run in the ſaid motion, in every minute of the houre ſixty Miles. If Aſtrologers will plead any thing to help themſelves herein, from the ſlowneſſe of other motions of the Stars, that are naturall, and internall to them; as that all the <hi>fixed Stars</hi> (which are known by their twinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to our ſight) move from North to South (as they ſay, ſo <hi>Alſted</hi>) in three thouſand five hundred years, and back again in three thouſand five hundred years, ſo that they finiſh not that motion under ſeven thouſand years; how then can any Age ſince the beginning of the World have experience what the Conjunction of the Stars may produce? So for the motions of the ſeven <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets:</hi> If they ſay (as <hi>Keckerman, &amp;c.</hi> affirm) that the Sun hath three Orbs: Firſt, that in which the Sun it ſelf is fixed, and is the middle Orb, and is excentricall to the World; that is, The World, or Earth is not juſt in the middle of it; by reaſon whereof the Sun is ſometimes in the <hi>Perige,</hi> namely nearer the Earth for ſome moneths; and ſometimes in the <hi>Apoge,</hi> to wit, more remote from the Earth, for other moneths. And in this <hi>Eccentrick</hi> Orb the Sun moves, as they ſay, according to the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the twelve Signs from Weſt to Eaſt, not finiſhing that motion under three hundred ſixty five dayes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſix hours. And withall as they aſſert, that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this Orb the Sun moves as in relation to the centre of the earth, one while ſwifter, another while ſlower; that is to ſay, it moves ſlower whiles it is on the <hi>Northern</hi> part of the World, lingering there an hundred eighty ſix
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:121621:117"/>dayes, eight hours, and twelve minutes; but runs ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on the <hi>Southern</hi> part of the World, diſpatching its race in an hundred ſeventy eight dayes, one and twenty hours, and twelve minutes; and ſo ſtay es longer with ſome of the Signs (as they ſay) and leſſe while with others. And that ſecondly, The Sun hath, as they ſay, a <hi>ſupreme</hi> Orb contiguouſly adjoyned above to the aforeſaid Orb. Thirdly, an <hi>inferiour</hi> Orb, in like manner adjoyned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath to the ſaid middle Orb, both partly Concentrick, partly Eccentrick (the uſe of which two Orbs, as held forth by Aſtronomers, I ſhall not here ſtay to relate.) And the motion of thoſe two extreme Orbs, is, as they confeſſe, very ſlow, ſo that they finiſh not their courſe, which is like ſome motion of the eighth Sphear, under fourty nine thouſand of years (as <hi>Keckerman</hi> affirms.) All which makes me again demand, how any men could ever attain to a certain experience of Conjunctions of Stars, ſeeing this number of fourty nine thouſand extends it ſelf to an age above ſeven times older then the creation of the Stars.</p>
                  <p>It would be two tedious to recite all the ſeverall Orbs and motions of all the other Planets, according to the common opinion; as, that the <hi>Moon</hi> hath five Orbs, ſome of which move ſwifter then thoſe of the Sun, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her twice every moneth in her <hi>Apoge</hi> or exaltation, and twice in her <hi>Perige</hi> or deſcention, with differences in both, that in the ſame <hi>Apoge</hi> it is ſometimes higher and ſometimes lower, and ſo in the ſame <hi>Perige;</hi> and hath one motion that is not finiſhed under eighteen years, ſeven moneths, and about twelve hours.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Saturn</hi> hath a motion whoſe courſe takes up thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years; <hi>Jupiter</hi> one of twelve, <hi>Mars</hi> one of two, <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> of one. And <hi>Mercuries</hi> motion (as <hi>Ceckerman</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms) <hi>Est admodum varius imo magna parte adhuc in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognitus;</hi> that is, <hi>It is wonderfull various, yea for the moſt part yet unknown.</hi> Now lay all theſe varieties and
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:121621:117"/>uncertainties together, and then judge what certainty of experience there can be had of the conjunctions of Stars, juſt ſo long and ſo much, as to make ſuch a ſure impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch influences and efficacies on men in the birth, as may duly and truly prognoſticate, that ſo ſhall ſuch a man be, and do; but ſo another, eſpecially in <hi>Twinnes.</hi> Thus the Doctours ſecond Argument. By which it is apparent that <hi>Will. Ramſey</hi> did neither rightly take, nor truly report the dint of the Doctours Argument, but runnes out into many extravagancies; which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, for the better clearing the coaſts round about the Argument, we will a little take into conſideration.</p>
                  <p>To that at <hi>(A)</hi> about the Doctours not bringing of an <hi>Example</hi> touching Twins; we ſay, that the Doctour did bring examples; See the Doctour ſecond Argument (afore inſerted) at the mark (**); which if need be might be named; though he then forbare in civility to the perſons and their generations.</p>
                  <p>To that he adds of <hi>one Doctours opinion;</hi> it is ſufficient for me to ſhew <hi>Will.</hi> falſe tongue, by minding the Reader that <hi>Doctour Homes</hi> did ſhew <hi>Doctour Auſtins</hi> opinion touching <hi>Twinns,</hi> that the conſideration of the diverſity of them, born ſo near at the ſame time is a great Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt Aſtrology; as is to be ſeen in the <hi>Doctours Demonology</hi> Chap. 10. Sect. 5.</p>
                  <p>At the end of that Section, in anſwer to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, that <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſhould ſay <hi>Aſtrologia perſcrutanda eſt, &amp;c.</hi> inſerted after in this Treatiſe.

                  <p>In that at <hi>(B)</hi> in aſſerting that Twinns are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

For in reaſon the <hi>formative</hi> part of the womb muſt needs be moſt tenaciouſly ſhut up for cheriſhing the conception as ſoon as the <hi>ſemen</hi> is claſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within it. And ancient experienced Phyſicians have demonſtrated it to the eye by corporeall diagrammes. Add the authority of that univerſall great Scholar in all Arts, Sciences, and Divinity, <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and the learned whome he quotes. <hi>Poſſidonius</hi> a Stoick (ſaith <hi>Auſtin de Civit.

                     </q> which muſt needs be in the ſame moment, or elſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation is altered, in regard of the ſwift motion of the heavens, running (as the Aſtrologers confeſſe) ſixty miles in a minute of an houre. And <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his ſixth cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter ſaith expresſly and peremptorily, <hi>That it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that in conception there is but one generative act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current.

For, that they talk of the <hi>Space of Time,</hi> between that point they call the <hi>Horoſcope</hi> in both the <hi>Twins Nativities;</hi> it is either not ſo ſignificant, as the diverſity of will, acts, manners and fortunes of the Twinns born do require; or elſe it is more ſignificant then their difference of honours, ſtate, nobility, or meanneſſe will permit; both which diverſities they place onely in the figure of Nativities. And if they ſhould be both born ere the Horoſcope were fully varied, then would I require a <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> in each particular of their fortunes, which cannot be found in any two Twinns that ever yet were born. But if the <hi>Horoſcope</hi> be changed, ere both be born, then for this diverſitie I will require a difference of Fathers, which Twinns cannot poſſibly have. Fruſtrate therefore is that notable fiction of the Potters wheel, which <hi>Nigidius</hi> (they ſay) anſwered one that plunged him in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, whereupon he was called the <hi>Potter.</hi> Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Potters wheel twiſe, or thriſe about as faſt as he could, he took ink, and in the turning made two marks (as it ſeemed) in one place of the wheels edge, and then ſtaying the wheel, the marks were found far aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one from another upon the edge of the wheel: Even ſo (ſaith he) in the ſwift courſe of heaven, though one child be born after another in as ſhort a time as I gave
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:121621:119"/>theſe two marks; yet in the heavens will be paſſed a great ſpace, And that (quoth he) is the cauſe of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of conditions, and fortunes betwixt two Twins. here is a figment now farr more brittle then the pots that were made by the wheel. For if there be thus much power in heaven (and yet cannot be comprehnnded by the conſtellations) that one of the Twins may be an heir, and inherit, and not the other; how dare thoſe Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logians give ſuch preſages unto others that are not Twins, when, as they are included in thoſe ſecret points in Nativities, which none can comprehend? But if they ſay they do prognoſticate this to others, becauſe they know it belongeth unto the known, and diſcerned ſpaces that paſſe in Nativities, and that thoſe moments that may come between the births of two Twins, do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern ſlight things, and ſuch as the Aſtrologian uſeth not to be troubled with: For no man will ask the calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, when he ſhonld ſit, walk, or dine?</q> how can this be ſaid, when we ſhew ſuch diverſity, in the manners, ſtates, actions, and fortunes of two Twins.</p>
                  <p>To that at <hi>[I]</hi> touching <hi>Pharez</hi> and <hi>Zara,</hi> the reply is eaſy and home: that what ſpace ſoever was between their births, and which ſoever was born firſt; yet being they did in part interchangeably put forth themſelves at the womb, which was the expoſing of themſelves to the influence of the heavens according to the <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> doctrin, (putting ſo much weight upon mens births) as likewiſe <hi>Jacobs</hi> continued ſucceſſive birth after <hi>Eſau; Jacobs</hi> hand holding <hi>Eſau's</hi> heel; ſo that the firſt is not wholly born, till the other be born in part, is argument enough, to prove that the Aſpect of Conſtellations upon the birth of ſuch Twinnes, is exceeding uncertain; and ſo the Aſtrologicall prediction as groundleſs. Which <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth notably argue out, (which may ſerve for a full anſwer to <hi>W. Ram.</hi> his frabble about <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi>) thus:<note place="margin">Aug. de Civi. at.

                     <q>In the ancient memory of our forefathers (to
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:121621:119"/>ſpeak of them of note) were two Twinnes born, ſo near together, that the ſecond held the firſt by the heel; yet in their lives, manners, and actions, was ſuch diſparitie, that that very difference made them enemies, one to another. I mean not this, that the one ſat when the other ſtood; nor that the one ſlept, when the other waked; theſe belong to thoſe firſt marks and moments, which they cannot comprehend, who erect thoſe figures of nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the Aſtrologers to judge upon. One of them bound himſef to ſerve for wages, the other ſerved not at all: the one was loved by his mother, ſo was not the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: the one loſt his honour, and inheritance (a matter of great moment among them) the other obtained it. And how great a difference was there in their marriag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, wives, children, and goods?</q> Exceeding much. Thus <hi>Auſtin,</hi> whom we have reaſon to believe farr before falſe tongu'd <hi>W. Ram.</hi> [at <hi>L. M. N. O. P. R.</hi>] or his <hi>Forged Philo</hi> (as the learned call him) whom <hi>W.R.</hi> there quotes; or his <hi>Ptolomy</hi> quoted at <hi>[S]</hi> At <hi>[T] Wil. Ram.</hi> conſuteth himſelf. For if as a Candie being leſſe then a Bowl, cannot ſhine light round about that Bowl, ſo the Planets that are leſs then the Earth, cannot ſhine round it; how then, can they pour down any influence at the ſame minute on the whole round of the Earth, in which many thouſands of infants are born, whoſe nativities all Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers will caſt, and from them all, undertake to predict? And for his intimation that the <hi>dexter</hi> and <hi>ſinister,</hi> that is, the <hi>oblique</hi> and <hi>indirect</hi> Aſpects of Starrs have as much power and influence, as thoſe that are <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular;</hi> it is contrary to plain ſence. For the ſun doth not ſo enlighten or heat with its oblique aſpect, as when it is perpe ndicular over us. And the Moon comes to her loſs of light, and to be of leſs operation, by the oblique aſpect of the ſun on it, and of it on the Sunne; in compariſon of the Moon at full; ut which time (as <hi>Wil.</hi> confeſt afore) the powerof the Moon is greater on things below,</p>

                  <p>But becauſe there hath been ſuch oft mention of <hi>Aſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical influences:</hi>

For by their vote, they ſeem to be no leſs then a part of Magic and <hi>Incarnation,</hi> or the appertenance thereof. <hi>Agrippa</hi> in his book of <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Philoſophy</hi> tels us, that <q>

And that the nature of all <hi>Idea's</hi> is the ſame. They ſay that <hi>Idea's</hi> are <hi>firſt</hi> in God himſelf, by way of cauſe, and that they are diſtinguiſhed among themſelves, by ſome relative conſiderations onely, leſt whatſoever is in the world, ſhould be one thing without any variety; and that they agree in eſſence, leſt God ſhould be a compound eſſence. In the <hi>ſecond</hi> place, they place them in the very Intelligible it ſelf, that is, in the <hi>Soul of the world,</hi> differing the one from the other by abſolute formes. So that all the <hi>Idea's</hi> in God indeed are but one forme; but in the ſoul of the wold, they are many. They are placed in the minds of all other things: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be joyned to the body, or ſeparated from the body, by a cetain participation, and now by degrees are diſtinguiſhed more and more. They are placed in nature, as certain ſmall ſeeds of formes infuſed by the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea's.</hi> And laſtly they place them in matter as ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes.</q> Hereunto may be added, <q>that in the ſoul of the world, there be as many Scienciall Formes of things, as <hi>Idca's</hi> in the mind of God, by which Formes ſhe did in the Heavens, above the Starrs, frame to her ſelf ſhapes alſo, and ſtamped upon all theſe ſome properties; Therefore, on theſe ſtarres, ſhaps, and properties, all vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of inferiour ſpecies, as alſo their properties do depend: ſo that every; ſpecies hath it's celeſtiall ſhape or figure
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:121621:120"/>that is ſutable to it, from which alſo proceeds a wonderful power of operating, which proper gift it receives fromit's own <hi>Idea,</hi> through the ſeminal formes of the ſoul of the world. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſame <hi>Agrippa</hi> in the ſame book, <hi>cap.</hi> 13. hath theſe words <hi>Provenit ergo virtus primò ab</hi> Ideis <hi>&amp;c.</hi> i.e. The form therfore and virtue of things come's firſt from the <hi>Idea's,</hi> then from the ruling and governing <hi>Intelligences,</hi> then from the Aſpects of the <hi>Heavens</hi> diſpoſing, and Laſtly from the tempers of the <hi>Elements</hi> diſpoſed, anſwering the influences of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, by which the elements themſelves are ordered, or diſpoſed.

(whoſe title is, <hi>That no divination without Aſtrology is perfect</hi>) writes thus. <q>We have ſpoken (ſaith <hi>Agrippa</hi>) in the foregoing Chapters, of diverſe kinds of divinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but this is to be noted, that all theſe require the uſe, and rules of Aſtrology, as a key moſt neceſſary for the knowledge of all Secrets, and <hi>That all kinde of divinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whatſoever, have their root and foundation in Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, ſo as without it they are of little or no uſe.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whether the <hi>Phyſiognomiſts</hi> look upon the body, or countenance, or forehead, or head, or the <hi>Southſayer</hi> ſerch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by <hi>Dreams</hi> or <hi>Auſpicy,</hi> that the judgement may be right the figure of heaven is alſo to be enquired into <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>But to go on with W. <hi>R.</hi> ſilly diſcourſe at <hi>[T]</hi> whereas (ſaith <hi>Wil.</hi>) the Doctour asketh what is the difference of natures in Twinnes, when the ſuperiour places are propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably bigger then the earth, but ſure he never read that part of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> concerning the ſeveral ſignificato rs in Twins which is the cauſe of his frivolous Quirck.</p>
                  <p>Now Reader, is this an anſwer to the Doctous. I pray thee read afore, that marked with <g ref="char:dtristar">*⁎*</g> (where the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours words do fitlyer put the queſtion that <hi>W.

                     </q> So <hi>W. Ram.</hi> undertakes to be a judge in this great Queſtion of Judiciall Aſtrology, (too heavy for his infant ſhoulders) and when he finds he wants wit what to anſwer to many objections, then he referres the <hi>Reader</hi> to <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> or to Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Heyden.</hi>

                  <p>To that at <hi>[V] Will.</hi> ſhall anſwer <hi>Will.</hi> here he ſaith, <hi>though the heavens be ſo ſwift, yet in compariſon of us it is not ſo much as an inch to ten thouſand Miles:</hi> and backs it with a <hi>lie</hi> apparently againſt ſenſe, viz. <hi>we may ſee</hi> (ſaith W. R.) <hi>that the Sun doth as to us move at all in two or three hours.</hi> And but a little afore at [F] quite contrary he hath theſe words, All that know any thing in Aſtrology, know that four minutes of time in the Birth, gives near up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a years time in directions. Let them reconcile <hi>this</hi> with <hi>that,</hi> who can. 'Tis no help for <hi>Will.</hi> to talk of <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad nos, as to us,</hi> when he is to anſwer <hi>quoad rem</hi> to the nature of the thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Romae Tybur amat, vento ſus Tybure Romam.</hi> He ſhoggles in the ſocket of his principles: when he is non-pluſſed with the ſwifneſſe of the heavens: then <hi>to us</hi> their motion is but <hi>ſlow, viz.</hi> not ſo much as an <hi>inch to ten thouſand miles:</hi> (which is a groſſe untruth. For according to our ordinary ſun-dials on walls, and towres, the ſun runnes a degree, that is three thouſand ſix hundred miles in an hour, which is an inch upon the Dial.) And when <hi>Ill-Will</hi> is confounded with the ſlowneſs of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others of the heavens, then <hi>four minutes difference of time, gives near a years time in direction:</hi> Which is alſo a groſs untruth <hi>quoad veritatem rei,</hi> if we ſpeak ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the truth of the thing, and not according to the Diabolicall traditions, received by Judiciall Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. For not any of the Planets, much leſs the fixed Starrs, do finiſh their daily motions in four or four hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red minutes, as we heard but now; but in each hour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning ſixty minutes, run three thouſand ſix hundred miles. And none but the Moon wholly finiſheth any other
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:121621:122"/>motion, in a Moneth. And in every minute, the whole conſtellation of all the Starres, is quite different, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens running in their daily motion in each minute, ſixty miles. Therefore ſtrong muſt the principles of Judiciall Aſtrology be, that lay the ſtreſs of their certainty of their Aſtrologicall predictions upon the Aſpect of the heavens; yet will <hi>now</hi> (ſuppoſe at this <hi>pre ſent minute</hi>) prognoſticate from an aſpect that is paſſed three minutes after, that is, is gone nineſcore miles off; for W. <hi>Ram.</hi> (if we follow his words) takes in four minutes, into one and the ſame conſideration. And who can truly tell the exact time of his Birth ſo near as four, or fourteen minutes? And though the great ſwiftneſs of the Heavens were (as <hi>Will. Ram.</hi> ſaith) in relation to the circumference of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and not of the Earth: why then doth <hi>Will.</hi> and his Fellow Aſtrologers conſider their motion ſuch as it is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to earthly Bodies here below? Why do they diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of their Motions by minutes? Do they not confeſs (that which they cannot deny) that every half, yea quarter of a minute, by the Conjunction of other Stars (how ſlow ſoever the Aſcenſions of ſome may be) there is a new, ſpecifically different beam of influence, radiated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth, all taking their circular turns to dart their efficacy, though upon the ſame Centre-point, if the Earth aad its Bodies were ſo ſmall? So that let the Heavens be never ſo ſwift, their varieties of influences doth touch by turn the things below. Onely here is the Knot (which the Doctour put) not yet ſolved; how ſuch ſuddain touches of influences, coming on, and going off, as in a moment, ſhould make any change on the Complexions of men on Earth, ſo as to ſpecificate them to ſuch a temper by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the temper of the Heavens at ſuch a minute, if the temper of the Conſtellation of the Heavens at that minute could poſſibly be known?</p>

If the eighth Sphere be about ſeven thouſand years fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing its courſe, then of neceſſity ſo long are the Stars fixed in that Sphere, finiſhing their courſe. 3.

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The Doctonr's third Argument.</hi> The third Argument. All Rules of Sciences &amp; Arts (by the fundamental Poſition of Artiſts) are <hi>Axiomes, Maxims, Theorems, Canons, &amp;c.</hi> that is, Moſt worthy, and moſt ſpecial Principles, I experiments, or Rules, for their verity and certainty. But ſuch are not the Rules of Aſtrology. Firſt, becauſe of the for ſaid various varieties and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties of Stars, both in their <hi>own</hi> motions, and in compariſon with <hi>others,</hi> Secondly, becauſe no man knoweth the particular qualities or eſſicacies of all the Stars. No Artiſt yet ever undertook to ſpeak of more then the ſeven <hi>Planets,</hi> and ſome few nominated <hi>Fixed Stars</hi> of ſome few ſeveral magmtudes; leaving out milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are neither named nor knewn. Yea Thirdly, thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Stars cannot be so much as ſeen a minute toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:121621:124"/>as the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> confeſs in their Diſcourſe of <hi>Via lactea,</hi> the <hi>Milkie way</hi> in the Heavens, to be ſeen in a moſt ſtarry Night, eſpeciall in Winter. Fourthly, becauſe all the Stars do ſhine upon the Earth at once, joyntly and promiſcuouſly; ſo that they that are under them cannot by any Rule from Nature know what influences ſhall be predominant in their Effects. Fifthly, they have more time to alter the Complexions of young People from the Cradle to Manhood, carried and walking abroad. I ſay, to alter their Complexion by radiation and influence; then to ſtamp an unchangeable impreſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them in the ſecret Chamber of their Birth; as we ſee many natural Men and Women, not differenced by grace, much altered from Melancholly to chearfulneſs <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that if ſome Stars in one Poſition, in an inſtant at Birth have a power to imprint; other Stars, and perhaps more prevalent, have likewiſe a power to blot out that in many years, and to inſtill a new one. Sixthly, there are many Cauſes below between us and the Stars to alter the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Stars, or interrupt their native operation; as the various Complexion of the Air, diverſity of Windes, the different poſtures and ſituations of men, as ſometimes under a direct, ſometimes under an oblique radiation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Seventhly, Aſtrologers depend on Clocks and Dials, to know the poſture of the Heavens at the hour of their prognoſticating; which Dials and Clocks often are falſe, which may make a wide difference in a minute, in which, as we heard, ſome motions of the Heavens run ſixty Miles. Eighthly the Aſtrologer cannot be able to allow exactly for the <hi>exaltation</hi> in the <hi>Apoge</hi> and <hi>deſcenſion</hi> in the <hi>Perige</hi> of the Planets, with their ſwifter motion in the <hi>one</hi> then in the <hi>other,</hi> ſo as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o determine juſtly how much po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of prevalence they may be in their influences at ſuch changes. Ninthly, man can never certainly conclude of a particular Event from a Cauſe that is moſt univerſal, moſt remote, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:121621:124"/>But the Stars are no other but ſuch a kinde of cauſe of mens Complexions and Actions; and thereſore are no ſure Grounds of Prediction concerning the future affairs of men. The Parents Complexion, divine Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, occaſions, and opportunities among men, and a mans own obedience or diſobedience to God, have far more influence into man to diſpoſe him to be, or do this or that, then all the myriads of Stars. Tenthly, Aſtrology contending for ſuch a power of Stars over the Soul of man (which is the Principle of all Actions) infers as if the Soul of Man were <hi>ex traduce,</hi> generated by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>

                              <p>GOod Reader, I have thought it convenient (for ſome ſpeciall cauſes) in this ſhort Treatiſe, to diſcloſe <q>a part of my mind unto thee, concerning the making of <hi>Prognoſtications,</hi> and if it might be, to perſwade thee, not to ſpend thy money in buying any of them. <hi>I have long ſtudied this Art, and was never quiet untill I had ſeen all the ſecrets of the ſame:</hi> but at the length, it pleaſed God to lay before me, the <hi>profaneneſſe</hi> of it, nay, I dare boldly ſay <hi>Idolatry</hi> although it be <hi>covered with fair and golden ſhews.</hi> Wherefore, that which I will ſpeak with grief, the ſame I would deſire thee to mark with ſome attention. My reaſon ſhall partly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern thee, partly the <hi>Prognoſticatour</hi> himſelf.</q>
                              </p>
                              <p n="1">1. Firſt <hi>on thy behalf.</hi> I reaſon thus.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. As a man doth ſee the bleſſings of God upon him, ſo he muſt alſo labour with a carefull diligence to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſtore of this life. But becauſe the affection of man is caryed headlong unto a greedy covetouſneſſe; this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire of overmuch carping and careing, muſt be bridled with two ſtrong bitts. Firſt, all our care muſt extend it ſelf no further, then the preſent day. Secondly, in care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we muſt not truſt unto our ſelves, but ſix all our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the mercy and providence of God who bleſſeth all, and without whoſe goodneſſe, nothing can come to paſſe, do what we will.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. As touching the firſt, we have the direction of our Saviour Chriſt: who teacheth us to pray on this wiſe. Matth. 6.11. <hi>Give us this day our daily bread,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are given to underſtand, that we are onely to ſeek for the preſent time, reſting with this perſwaſion, that he which hath bleſſed us this day, will alſo to morrow, and the next day ſhew his like goodneſſe unto us. Again, in the ſame place, our Saviour Chriſt ſpeaketh on this wiſe. Matth. chap. 6. v. 34. <hi>Care not then for the morrow: for the morrow ſhall care for it ſelf: the day
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:121621:127"/>hath enough with his own grief.</hi> By this welearn, that God will provide for every day all things neceſſary, though we do not encreaſe the preſent grief, with caring and caſting in our heads how we ſhall live in the time to come. Now tell me what is the cauſe that thou year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doſt buy a <hi>Prognoſtication,</hi> and one of thoſe, which tell the ſtrangeſt things: Is it becauſe thou haſt a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to reade the ſtyle of <hi>Prognoſtications?</hi> Or becauſe thou wouldeſt learn to <hi>Prognoſticate?</hi> Or becauſe the pictures and Characters which they make, delight thy mind? it were folly to be perſwaded of this, ſeeing the very cauſe it ſelf is manifeſt. Thy whole deſire is to fill thy coffers, and to heap up wealth, thou art afraid leſt thou ſhalt become poor, therefore thou greedily buyeſt thee <hi>Prognoſtications,</hi> and continually ſearcheſt all the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of them, to ſee the ſtate of the year to come, even thus in mind reaſoning with thy ſelf. <q>I can never be qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, nor take my ſleep, untill ſuch time as I have known the ſtate of the year enſuing, that I may frame my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe accordingly: This next year there will be much rain, it will rot corn upon the ground, it will be ſpoiled, I will keep my corn untill the next year following: I find that corn will be dear about half a year hence, I will not ſell my corn now, but keep it, that I may have plenty of money for it, and ſufficient beſide, to maintain my houſe: the ſea and land is calm and quiet this year, the next year many ſhipwracks and troubles in many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys will fall, now I will fraught my ſhips that then I may be quiet.</q> Theſe imaginations are lively arguments of thy diffidence, and deſpair in the goodneſſe and loving kindneſſe of God. If thou fear God, love God, put thy whole truſt in God, thou art content to refer thy whole preſervation unto the hands of God: now, theſe proling and ranging conceits of the time to come, argue that either thou never thinkeſt on God, or at the leaſt perſwadeſt thy ſelf, that either he will not, or cannot help thee. Wherefore
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:121621:128"/>ſeeing the having of <hi>Prognoſtications,</hi> cometh of <hi>ſo wicked cauſes,</hi> as is the greedy deſire of proſperity, and wealth, and argueth ſome kind of diffidence in God: when thou readeſt theſe my words, examine thine own heart, if thou find my ſayings true (as certainly thou ſhalt) never here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after deſire to know the ſtate of the year before-hand, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be for the ſeaſons of the year, which I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>thou mayſt in ſome part, without any skill, even by thine own experience.</hi>

The <hi>Prognoſticatour,</hi> if he be asked whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he confeſſe the <hi>providence of God,</hi> he will with all his heart <hi>confeſſe</hi> it: but by <hi>his deeds he doth deny it,</hi> for all the things whatſoever, which can happen in a whole year, he attributeth them to the <hi>ſtars,</hi> and ſo he publiſheth his predictions, alwayes mentioning ſtars, never, or very ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, making any ſignification of the <hi>power, and juſtice, mercy, and everlasting wiſdome of God.</hi> And ſurely, even for the very paring of thy nails, for the cutting of thy hair, for the putting on of thy ſhooes, for taking a journey two or three miles from thine houſe, for obtaining at Gods hands thy requeſt, for making thy bargain with thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, for all thine actions be they never ſo ſmall: theſe wiſe men (if thou wilt ask their adviſe) will give thee coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell from the ſtars. Now when theſe their irreligious predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ſhall be had in thy boſome, and read of thee daily, thou being a man unlearned and worldly given, never hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any mention of the ſpeciall providence, and hand of God in every thing, but long diſcourſes of the virtues of Planets, and ſigns, doeſt never think upon the wonderfull and moſt infinite power of God, working after a ſpeciall manner in every matter, but are drawn ſtraight wayes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an admiration of the <hi>Aſtrologer,</hi> and a great fear of the conſtellations of heaven. An experience of this I found in thee, about two years ago. A learned man (yet in this caſe far deceived) wrote <hi>an Astrologicall diſcourſe of the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:121621:128"/>conjunction between Jupiter and Saturn,</hi> wherein he ſhewed of great alteration in every thing to fall. At this thou waſt ſore agaſt, thy mind was incumbred with fett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thy goods to ſet them in order againſt that day: thy ſong for half a year was nothing elſe, but, the conjunction the conjunction: the day being come, what ſtaring was there and gazing into heaven, to ſee the meeting of thoſe two Planets: Now all this while, where was Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence? where was that truſt and rejoycing in him? Wherefore me thinketh that in a Chriſtian Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, thoſe onely books ſhould be publiſhed for thy uſe, which might beat into thy head, and make thee every houre and moment to think on the providence of God: Contrarywiſe, to tell thee the means which God doth uſe, to thunder out the aſpects and conſtellations of ſtars, and ſeldome to mention of his providence, maketh thee to fear, and admire, and love the means, quite forgetting the work of God in the means. <hi>This fault was very rife a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Iſraelites, who came yearly unto Aſtrologers and wiſe men:</hi> Wherefore that which is ſpoken by <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> chap. 10. v. 12. unto them, is alſo ſpoken unto thee. <hi>Hear ye the word of the Lord, that he ſpeaketh unto you, O houſe of Iſrael: Thus ſaith the Lord, learn not the way of the heathen, and be not afraid for the ſigns of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, though the heathen be afraid of ſuch:</hi> In like ſort, God forbiddeth his people of <hi>England</hi> to give credit, or fear the conſtellations and conjunctions of Stars and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets which have <hi>no power of themſelves,</hi> but are governed by him, and their ſecret motions and influences are <hi>not known to man,</hi> and therefore there can be no certain judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof. If thou wilt not hear and follow this which I ſay, ſee what will enſue. Thou ſeeſt that the greateſt matters which theſe <hi>Diviners</hi> and <hi>Prognoſticatours</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, fall out flat otherwiſe then they ſay, to their <hi>perpetuall ſhame.</hi> Truely I am perſwaded, that it is the judgement of God upon them (although they cannot ſee it) who
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:121621:129"/>maketh them, when they think they are <hi>moſt wiſe, to be moſt fools.</hi> For ſo the Lord uſed the wiſe men and <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers of Chaldea,</hi> as he ſpeaketh by his Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> chap. 44. v. 24. <hi>I am the Lord that made all things, that ſpread out the heavens alone and ſtretch out the earth by my ſelf, I deſtroy the tokens of Soothſayers, and make them that conjecture fools, and turn their wiſe men back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and make their knowledge fooliſhneſſe.</hi> Doſt thou then O careleſſe and miſerable man, think to eſcape the ſame, or greater puniſhment being a cauſe of this fault, for if none deſired to know what is to come, none would buſie themſelves in that vanity. Wherefore reade the word of God in the 18. of <hi>Deut.</hi> verſe 9. <hi>When thou ſhalt come</hi> (ſaith the ſpirit of God) <hi>into the Land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, thou ſhalt not learn to do after the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations of thoſe nations.</hi> In the words following <hi>Moſes</hi> numbreth nine abominations.</p>

The reaſons which concern the <hi>Prognosticatour,</hi> and may avail to the perſwading of thee, not to buy any more of their unprofitable books, as theſe which follow, Firſt, their <hi>unability</hi> in <hi>Prognosticating:</hi> Secondly, their <hi>manifeſt untruths:</hi> Thirdly, their <hi>impieties:</hi> Fourthly, their <hi>tricks of deceit.</hi> What? can they not foretell that which is to come? can they not make conjectures of that which is like to enſue?

                              <p>The true uſe of the heavens conſiſteth in many points. 1. To declare the glory of God. <hi>The heavens</hi> (ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Pſal. 19.2.) <hi>declare the glory of God, and the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament ſheweth the work of his hands.</hi> It is an Alphabet written in great Letters, in which is deſcribed the maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie of God, and that by theſe four ſpeciall points: Firſt, the Majeſty of the work it ſelf. 2. The infinite multitude of Stars. 3. By the wonderfull variety of Stars. 4. By the greatneſſe of the Stars.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. Secondly, it maketh ſinners and wicked men inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable before the judgement ſeat of God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. <hi>For the inviſible things of him</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>that is, his eternall power, and God-head are ſeen by the creation of the world being conſiaered in his works, to the intent that they ſhould be without excuſe.</hi>

                              <p n="3">3. Thirdly, they ſerve to the appointment of times, as day, night, moneth, year, which are both meaſured and deſcribed by the courſe of the Sun, and Moon, and other Stars. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.14. And ſo the feaſt of the Iſraelites, and the computation of the yeare in our Church, dependeth thereupon, and without them there would be great confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion both in the common wealth and Church.</p>
                              <p n="4">4. Fourthly, they ſerve to be ſigns, that is to foretell things to come. And they are ſigns either of <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> things, or things which be <hi>ordinary.</hi> When they are ſigns of extraordinary things, then there is and appeareth in them ſome extraordinary work of God: as appeareth
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:121621:130"/>in theſe examples which follow. At the ſuffering of Chriſt, not onely <hi>the vail of the temple rent, and the dead roſe forth of their graves, Matth.</hi> 27. but alſo the Sun was wholly eclipſed, the Moon being in the full. At which ſight, <hi>Dyoniſius Areopagita,</hi> a good <hi>Aſtronomer</hi> ſpake theſe words: <hi>Either the frame of the world is deſtroyed, or the God of nature ſuffereth.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Ezek.</hi> cha. 32. v. 78. being commanded to prophecy the deſtruction of <hi>Egypt.</hi> he firſt putteth down ſuch extraordinary ſigns: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſecond coming of our Saviour Chriſt, there ſhall be ſigns in the Sun and Moon, and in the Stars. Laſtly, the extraordinary going back of the Sun ſignified the length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the life of King <hi>Ezekias.</hi> Secondly, the Stars are ſigns of generall things, which happen ordinarily every year in nature among us.</p>

                              <p>I ſay <hi>generall,</hi> becauſe the <hi>particular eſtate and affairs of men can in no wiſe be fore-ſignified by the ſtars.</hi> I ſay <hi>ordinary,</hi> becauſe the things which fall out ſeldome, and are beſides the common courſe of nature, as plenty of all things, famine, plague, war; everſions of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, <hi>&amp;c. Do not depend upon the Stars.</hi> For the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:121621:130"/>confirming of this, I have three reaſons: Firſt, in the 1. of <hi>Geneſis</hi> v. 14, 15. God ſaith, <hi>that he made the lights to be ſigns,</hi> and yet the ſame God in the 47. of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay</hi> v. 13.14. ſaith, <hi>he will deſtroy the ſigns of them which divine:</hi> flatly forbidding us to uſe Stars, as means to judge of any thing to come, ſaving onely of thoſe, of which they are expreſly made ſigns of God in the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: all which are put down before. Secondly, this is manifeſt by the order of the creation: <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.12.14. <hi>The third day God created upon the earth hearbs and trees, and the earth brought forth fruits and was fertile: the fourth day God commanded lights to be made in the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament of heaven, to ſeparate the day and the night, and to be for ſigns and for ſeaſons, and dayes, and moneths, and then it was ſo, and then God ſaw it was good.</hi> Out of which I gather that it cannot be a ſign cauſing famine, or plenty and fertileneſſe, becauſe fertility went before the creation of the hoſt of heaven. Alſo of warres, and plagues, and the particular eſtates of men, they can be no ſigns, becauſe man was not yet created, and yet even then they were ſigns. Some will ſay they were no ſigns of thoſe matters in the creation, but now they may be, and are: No, for the works which God created, he now preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, neither increaſing, nor diminiſhing any thing in them. <hi>Philo Judaeus</hi> in his book <hi>de opificio mundi,</hi> ſaith, <hi>he was perſwaded that God foreſeeing the minds of men, given to ſearch ſtrange matters to come, did in this order create the heavens, to confute and diſprove their imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> Thirdly the Heavens and Stars were made for the uſe of man, and man is their end, ſo that it is abſurd to imagine they have any force in the affairs of man. Now then <hi>Prognoſticatours</hi> if they will foreſhew of ſtrange things to come: they muſt undo the work of their Creatour, and give unto it new uſes, otherwiſe they ſhall not be able to Prognoſticate as they yearly do.</p>

                              <p>The providence of God is his decree by which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth how every thing ſhall come to paſs. The conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall execution of this decree is ordinarily by meanes, but often without meanes, The means which God uſeth are either generall or ſpeciall. Generall are theſe by which he governeth all the whole world, and every particular thing, which concerneth this life: unto this kind are referred ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall creatures, called Angels, by whom the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſay the heavens are governed, and we ſee that whole Kingdomes, Provinces, and Citties have been kept and defended by them, as alſo conſumed and deſtroyed. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the ſtarrs and heavenly bodies are uſed of God to govern and order things here below, as it is the 19. <hi>Pſal. Nothing is hid from the beat of the ſunne.</hi> And by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Hoſea.</hi> the Lord ſpeaketh thus <hi>I will hear the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, the heavens ſhall hear the earth, the earth ſhall hear the corn, the corn ſhall hear Iſrael,</hi> But this inſtrument is <hi>onely a generall</hi> inſtrument, and hath his work in <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> matters of <hi>nature.</hi> Beſide theſe means, there be many other by which God ruleth the world. In the beginning he ſet <hi>man</hi> over the whole world, that he might have rule over fiſhes, fouls, and beaſts, and al things els. He apointed <hi>huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands</hi> to govern their wives, he ſet the <hi>first-born</hi> before their brethren, as <hi>Cain</hi> before <hi>Abel:</hi> Princes over Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Kingdomes, Common-wealths, and therefore by reaſon of their dignity calleth them Gods. There be <hi>Governours</hi> of Families, <hi>Fathers</hi> over their Children, <hi>Maſters</hi> over their Servants. Yet God hath more near care in preſerving and governing his choſen, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the 43. of <hi>Eſay. Thus ſaith the Lord God that created thee. O</hi> Jacob: <hi>and he that formed thee O</hi> Iſrael: <hi>fear not, for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by my name. thou art mine: when thou paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt through the waters, I will be with thee, and through the flouds, that they do not overflow thee, When thou walkeſt thorough the very fire, thou ſhalt not be burnt,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:121621:131"/>neither ſhall the flame kindle upon thee, for I am the Lord thy God, the holy one of I ſrael thy Saviour.</hi> This is alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by that Sympathy which is in the Lord, when his children are afflicted as appeareth by the 11. of <hi>Zechariah He which toucheth you, toucheth the appleof mine eye,</hi> And in the 9. of the <hi>Acts, Saul Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me,</hi> that is, <hi>my elect.</hi> Wherefore therebe alſo ſpeciall means by which he more carefully governeth the elact. As be Angels whom <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> calleth <hi>Miniſtring ſpirits:</hi> it is certain they defend every one of the elect particularly. Hitherto may be referred the preaching of the Word of God, the miniſtring of the Sacraments.</p>
                              <p>All theſe means God's provid ence uſeth, firſt that he might ſhew his goodneſſe towards us: ſecondly, that he might be known to be the Lord over all, thirdly, that we might be thankfull, becauſe he not onely himſelf governeth us, but alſo maketh his creatures to ſerve our turns. But this muſt be noted (as I ſaid before) that in all theſe ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary cauſes, beſide their naturall work, which God hath given them, there is alſo the ſpeciall work of God his ſpeciall hand ſhewed. God worketh not by ſecond cauſes, as Magiſtrates govern their Common Wealths by their inferiour officers. For they ſo govern by them, that they do nothing or very little themſelves; and peradventure, never know what is done. God governeth not the world ſo, but in every particular work, he hath his particular ſtroke. That the thunder burneth, moveth, hurteth, it is the generall providence of God: but that it burneth, or hurteth this or that man, on this or that part, in this or that manner, it is the ſpecial providence of the ſame God. The Lord hath ſhewed his ſpeciall providence in one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent example. If <hi>the hatchet</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>fall forth of the hand of him which loppeth the tree, and kill a man in the way, I the Lord have killed him,</hi> God alſo governeth the world immediately, and his providence worketh without means, and many things he bringeth to paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:121621:132"/>all means, which is manifeſt by that of <hi>Matthew, Man liveth not by bread onely, but by every word which proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Now to come to our <hi>Prognosticatours,</hi> and <hi>Moon-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> how ſhall they be able to know what will come to paſs hereafter? For firſt, the Heavens being onely one particular Inſtrument of Gods providence, amongſt many, they cannot certainly and truly ſay, this thing or that thing proceedeth from the Heavens. Secondly, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not determine whether God in extraordinary matters, as Plague, Famine, Barrenneſs, diſtempered Weather, Earthquakes, Wars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Doth work immediately, or with means: if with means, they cannot determine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Heavens, or Angels, or men, or any other things be the means of his providence. Thirdly, if they were able to know what the Heaven worketh naturally, yet they were never the better; for God beſide the power of the Heavens hath in all things his particular working provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, altering, and framing, and bending as Wax his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to his good will.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>The third Reaſon the want of experience.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>If our <hi>Prognoſticators</hi> have any means to foretell things to come, they have thoſe means either without experience, or with experience: if they have them without experience, then muſt thou account all which they do to be fooliſh Dreams, and deceit. For all kinde of humane Learning which is profitable, and hath uſe in the Life of Man, is taken from often obſervations, and experience. If it be ſaid, that they have their Directions in <hi>prognosticating</hi> from experience, and that of all times; I will convince them thus: True experience of the Cauſes of Things is an often obſerving of the Effects of the ſame Cauſes, with this Ground, that they can proceed from no other thing. The <hi>Phyſician</hi> ſaith <hi>Rheubarde,</hi> doth purge Choller. Well, how knoweth he this? he hath often tried this, and that in old men, young men, children: and hath found,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:121621:132"/>that in the Bodies of all Men, the Cauſe of purging this Humour, could be aſcribed to nothing elſe. Wherefore he may peremptorily conclude, <hi>Rheubarde</hi> purgeth Choller. Our <hi>Prognosticatours,</hi> in the Heavens can have no ſuch experience. For they cannot obſerve often the ſame poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Stars in the Heaven. The order and cauſe of the fixed Stars and Planets, which we finde in the Heavens this day, the next day will be changed, <hi>and never the like again.</hi> They will ſay, in deed, although the ſame poſition of the whole Heaven never happen, yet the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions of notable Stars, the ſame Riſings and Settings, and the ſame Conſtellations of the chiefeſt Stars are marked often. I ſay again, that when theſe Eclipſes and great Conjunctions happen the reſt of the Stars being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe affected then they were before, and having new Poſitions, may either increaſe or diminiſh their Effects, or elſe hinder them, and quite take them away. As we ſee when the <hi>Sun</hi> caſting his beams into a Chamber, the light of Candles, and Torches, and Fires do make it ſhine dim, yet theſe being abſent it will ſhine bright. Again, they are not able to ſay, that Conſtellations, which they have marked, are Cauſes of thoſe Effects which follow, as Wars, Diſeaſes, diſtempered Weather, Earthquakes, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For in thoſe things which happen together, the one is not the cauſe of the other. When <hi>Nero</hi> played up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Harp, <hi>Rome</hi> was on fire; yet <hi>Nero's</hi> playing on the Harp was no Cauſe of the burning of <hi>Rome.</hi> Alſo theſe Effects may have other Cauſes in the Heaven, then thoſe which they mark, and they may come immediately from God, they may come onely from the will of man: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing that they cannot aſſure themſelves that thoſe Eclipſes, and Conjunctions are the Works of ſuch Effects upon Earth, and they cannot have often Obſervations of the courſe of Heaven, their Rules of Predictions are feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſuppoſed, and not built upon true experience. Let a man which knoweth not one Herb, take all kindes of
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:121621:133"/>Herbs, and put them into a great Veſſel, yet ſo, that there be more of ſome Herbs, and leſs of other ſome; let him beat them all together, and make a compound virtue of all their virtues; Can he now tell the nature and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of every particular Herb? Can he divide and ſever by any help the virtue of one Herb from another? No indeed. The ſame thing may be ſaid of the Stars of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; all their Lights, and all their influences (as they term it) are in the lower Bodies: more plainly, every earthly Body hath in it all the ſecret powers, and working of every particular Star: ſo that they make (as it were) a compound operation riſing of all, or of the moſt of their virtues joyned together? for the <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> hold, that although the Light may be hindred by the thickneſs of the Body, yet the heavenly influence pierceth through all. Therefore they are not able to ſever, and learn the nature of theſe Stars, except they can ſtop the influence of what Stars they liſt, and bring them into what compaſs they will. Yet thus much I will grant them, that they may have a little knowledge of the virtue of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> and ſome other Stars: as we ſee thoſe Herbs in the former compoſition, whoſe virtues be the chiefeſt, though not fully, yet ſomewhat do repreſent their nature, and ſhew themſelves above the reſt. But what is this to the purpoſe? If I confeſs the operations of the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon.</hi> If I ſhall grant that <hi>Saturn</hi> is in nature cold and dry, <hi>Jupiter</hi> warm and moiſt, <hi>Mars</hi> hot and dry, <hi>Venus</hi> cold and moiſt, <hi>Mercury</hi> in nature mixt, the notable fixed Stars in the <hi>Zodiack</hi> to be of the nature of the Planets, and to have manifeſt operations, as the riſing of the <hi>Dog</hi> to make heat and tempeſtuous Seas, the riſing of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturus</hi> to make rain and ſhowres, <hi>Pleiades</hi> to be of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Mars,</hi> and the <hi>Moon, &amp;c.</hi> what will all this ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to make a <hi>Prognostication?</hi> for ſeeing all ſtars have their own powers, and peradventure alſo the leaſt ſtars, which we make no account of, have great Effects amongſt
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:121621:133"/>us (as one Grain of <hi>Musk</hi> in the <hi>Apothecaries</hi> ſhop ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a greater ſmel then all other Powders, be they never ſo many) nothing will the knowledg of the operation of ſome ſtars prevail, the reſt being not known and never regarded. They wil ſay, they have ſome experience, but yet imperfect. I have ſhewed how they have no true experience at all: and their imperfect experience maketh them perfect Liars.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>The fourth Reaſon, the ignorance of Cauſes.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>A man which will judge rightly of any matter by the Cauſes, muſt not onely conſider the <hi>common</hi> Cauſes, but he muſt alſo with them confer the <hi>particular</hi> Cauſes of all things which happen amongſt us, ſo he ſhall judge aright. In Heaven the ſtars be common Cauſes of all things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, becauſe they ſhew their virtue on every matter, one way or other. The ſame things have their peculiar efficients, and matters, and forms, by which, and not by the Heavens, they are made that, whatſoever they are. Theſe proper Cauſes, becauſe their natures be unknown unto us, I cannot ſee how the <hi>Prognoſticatour</hi> is able to foretell any thing to come, in good and convenient man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, laying aſide all deceiving, and forging of untruths. To make this more plain, I will uſe this ſimilitude, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an Hen to ſit upon many Eggs, ſome of her own, ſome of divers other Fowls; ſhe impartoth her heat e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually unto them; at the length ſhe hatcheth, and ſome of her Chickens are Cocks, ſome Hens, ſome Crows, ſome Partridges, ſome Doves, ſome black, ſome white. ſome like and live, ſome die, ſome are killed of the Kite, ſome are roſted. No man (I think) will profeſs ſo much skill, as to ſay, that he by the conſidering of the Hen and her heat which is a common Cauſe of the Chickens, and all that befalleth them, is able to tell, why of this Egg came a Patridge, of that a Crow, why this Egg had no Chicken, why that had a dead Chicken, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> except he do therewith all adjoyn the conſideration of the particular Effects. The Heaven is as it were a Hen, foſtring under
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:121621:134"/>her Wings all earthly things, imparting his virtue and heat unto all. Can our <hi>Prognoſticatour,</hi> by the <hi>erecting</hi> of <hi>Figures,</hi> by conſidering the <hi>Diſpoſition of every Planet in their Houſes,</hi> and the ſignifications of every thing, judge, why this man is wealthy, that man a Begger, why this Noble-man dieth this Year, none the next Year, why it is naught to travell this way good to travell that way, why theſe Diſeaſes abound, and not other why Corn ſhall be dear this Quarter, not the next, why this Week is fair and temperate, that Week, that Moneth unſeaſonable and tempeſtuous. Tiuly, it is a thing <hi>flat impoſſible.</hi> They muſt hereun to adjoyn the particular nature of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, the particular Cauſes both in mens mindes and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as, education, place, honeſty, birth, bloud, ſickneſs, health, ſtrength, weakneſs, meat, drink, liberty of minde, learning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all other ſpeciall circumſtances; which they never do, as we may ſee in their <hi>Prognoſtications:</hi> and if they would do it, yet they could not. Wherefore I muſt needs ſay this, that their folly is great in publiſhing their <hi>Prognoſtications:</hi> and thou alſo greatly to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, which by thy greedy deſire giveſt them great occaſion to be unprofitably occupied.</p>
                              <p>To ſhew more briefly and plainly of their unability in <hi>prognoſticating, Hoſ.</hi> 2. although I grant the Stars have great force, yet I ſay they cannot judge of things to come. And there be ſix Impediments.</p>
                              <p>The firſt Impediment is, imbecility of wit, for as mans eye from the Earth beholding the Heavens and the Stars, perceiveth them not in their juſt quantity, but as very ſmal Lights: for indeed the <hi>Sun</hi> is a hundred and threeſcore and ſix times bigger then the Earth, <hi>Saturn</hi> ninety times, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> ninety and five, <hi>Mars</hi> one and an half, the <hi>Moon</hi> is the thirty and ninth part of the Earth: the biggeſt fixed Stars contain the Earth an hundred and ſeven times, the Stars of the ſecond magnitude ninety, the third ſeventy times, the fourth magnitude fifty and four times, the fifth
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:121621:134"/>magnitude thirty and five times, the ſixth magnitude eighteen times. So the weakneſs of mans underſtanding is not able to conceive and learn the things which the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens do bring to paſs on Earth.</p>
                              <p>The 2d Impediment, the infinite number of Stars, which no doubtall have great power, although we do not finde it. For the <hi>Prognoſticatour</hi> onely maketh one thouſand twenty and eight Stars, and of theſe he taketh onely heed unto a very few: which is as though a man ſhould judge the power of an Army, by the power of one or two Souldiers and Captains, not by the power of the whole company.</p>
                              <p>The third Impediment, is the infinite varieties of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of Stars, and the parts of Heaven, which <hi>Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> grant to be: yet they do not know them. As touching the nature of the Fixed Stars, they know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but by colour, which is red, leady, white, pale, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> reſembling ſome Planet. And becauſe they know not the virtue of all Stars, and every part of Heaven, they are not able to judge any thing but to their own ſhame, no more then the <hi>Phyſician</hi> is able to know the nature of the compound Medicine without the knowing of every Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                              <p>The fourth Impediment, the manifold and daily change of the Motions, Poſitions, and Configurations of the Stars: for if a man could tell both the number and nature of Stars, yet the variety of Poſitions breedeth Trouble, and hindreth right judgement: becauſe by this means the powers of Stars are increaſed, diminiſhed, and changed. And theſe Rules which ſerved for ancient times to foretell things, will not ſerve us, becauſe all the Fixed Stars have changed their places, and the reft are daily changed.</p>
                              <p>The fifth Impediment, the infinite variety of inferiour things, which do hinder, pervert, change, receive, or not receive the virtue and Predictions of Stars as the nature of the Soil, the diſpoſition natural of Air, orders and
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:121621:135"/>Conſtitutions of the Common-wealth, occaſions, educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, inſtitution, kindes of meat and drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The ſixth Impediment, the will of man, which freely in common matters chuſeth this and refuſeth that. There are many things which are cauſed without any work of Stars, onely by the will of man, and ſtudy, as we ſee in <hi>Socrates, Demosthenes,</hi> and other, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Thus much ſhall ſuffice to ſhew that they cannot <hi>prognoſticate</hi> of things inſuing; now follow their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold untruths, and moſt falſe Rules. In diſcloſing them I will keep the ſame order they uſe in their <hi>Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacks.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>In the firſt or ſecond leaf of their Books thou ſhalt finde a Picture of Man's Body with the twelve Signes round about it they call it the <hi>Anatomy of Man's Body,</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how the twelve Signes have Government of the ſame, for the <hi>Moon</hi> or any other Significatour of any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Sign, they ſay, that it is dangerous to box, to ſear that part, or to let bloud in it, which is ſubject to the dominion of that Sign, All theſe are nothing but vain Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, as I will manifeſtly prove.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. Whereas they call it an <hi>Anatomy,</hi> me thinks, it is a butcherly <hi>Anatomy;</hi> nay, that of the Butchers is far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for they joyn Head and Appurtenance together; theſe men being ſparing give <hi>Aries</hi> the Head, <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Cancer</hi> the Heart and Lungs, As for the Liver, I know not which Sign hath it, peradventure in old time men had no Livers. At the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of a Carrian, Crows deal friendly, for every one hath ſomewhat; but in the diviſion of Man's Body, Signes play foul play, for <hi>Capricorn</hi> hath got no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a pair of Knees. It is like that the Signes ſcram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling for their portions, <hi>Capricorn</hi> being ſlow got no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, hereupon compaſſion being had, there was a ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering made, and <hi>Sagittarius</hi> gave the lower part of the Thigh, <hi>Aquarius</hi> the higher part of the Legg which both together make the Knee. But to deliver thee without all
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:121621:135"/>doubt, mark theſe reaſons which follow. I. The ſigns cannot have any ſuch dominion over mans body: I make it manifeſt thus. There is no corporall heaven in deed above the firmament, yet becauſe the firmament or eighth Sphear hath many motions, to give reaſons to thoſe moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Aſtronomers have feigned two heavens above the firmament, the Chriſtaline heaven, and the firſt move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or tenth Sphear, which they divide into twelve parts, which parts they call ſigns. Now, I pray you tell me,<note place="margin">The 12. Signs feigned.</note> is it poſſible to conceive that an imagined part of any imagined heaven void of all ſtars, ſhall either have in it ſelf, or give unto other Stars power to govern the parts of mans body? More reaſonable was that man, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked what was the cauſe of the ſands in <hi>Sandwitch</hi> haven, he anſwered the building up of <hi>Tenterton</hi> Steeple. Secondly the government of the Signs in the body is not taken from experience in nature, but feigned long ago by ſome drowſie pate, and now becauſe it hath a cloak of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, it is allowed. More naturall was this kinde of way, that hot ſigns ſhould govern hot parts, cold ſigns cold parts, earthly ſigns earthly parts. So Aries ſhould govern the heart and the vitall bloud, not the head, and the reſt of the ſigns thoſe parts which are of their nature and diſpoſition. Thirdly great experience of many men daily confuteth this rule. For many learned Phyſicians, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Chirurgians have by infinite examples found, that if a man be let bloud in the ſign, or lanched, or boxed, or ſeared, no harm enſueth, nay they have given teſtimony that the patients have found even then great comfort. Wherefore let not theſe things trouble thy mind any more, but let them be numbred even amongſt vain and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table fables.</p>

                              <p>Here, I pray thee, mark their naughty dealings, how they abuſe thy ignorance, to make themſelves skilfull, and to do more then they can do. For, if the judgements of the beſt <hi>Astrologers</hi> may be taken, certainly moſt of theſe elections cannot be preſcribed to thee, unleſſe they know before hand the figure of thy Nativity. For all Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which concern thy perſon, muſt be moderated (to ſpeak as plainly as their toyes will ſuffer me) by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the root of thy Nativity, and by the monethly and diurnall progreſſions of thy preſent Revolution. If any of theſe pretend ſome evill, the particular election may be a means to increaſe, and to bring it to paſſe. For example, ſuppoſe thou being a man toward marriage, in the Almanack thou findeſt a good day noted by the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoſticatour</hi>
                                 <pb n="265" facs="tcp:121621:136"/>to marry in: thou takeſt thy opportunity: after a while, thou art weary of thy life: the firſt day of thy marriage was the laſt day of thy joy. What is the cauſe of this? All the Planets which were ſignifiers of thy marriage in thy nativity, were then evilly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and peradventure alſo, at the firſt thou waſt born, they received ſome diſgrace. So then thou mayeſt lay all blame, partly upon thy ſelf for believing and partly upon the Prognaſticatour, who deceived thee. But to come unto particulars, the elections of dayes to purge the body with any kind of purgation, and to comfort the ſame, are moſt rediculous. Why do they not alſo preſcribe hours of eating meat? Why do they not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the kinds of meats and drinks, which we muſt eat and uſe daily? If thou ſee that God doth daily bleſſe the enterpriſes of thoſe Phyſicians, which never regard thoſe elections in miniſtring to their patients: never eſteem of them, let them go as lyes to the Devil from whence they came. Concerning the elections of dayes to ſowe, to ſett, to plant, to lop, they are alſo fooliſh: the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall obſervation of the ſeaſon of the year, in which theſe things are to be done is ſufficient. And S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his book <hi>de civitate Dei</hi> laugheth at the folly of them, which chooſe particular dayes to do their husbandry, as though ſome certain poſitions of ſtars had ſome ſpeciall influence to the things which are ſown then. His reaſon is, becauſe many grains of corn being caſt into the ground to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſpringing up together, and riping all at one time: yet ſome of them are blaſted, ſome are eaten of birds, ſome are trodden down under foot, ſome ſtand and are never touched. The reſt of the elections, and eſpecially that of laying foundations is moſt abſurd. They ſay, that if an houſe, a city, a town have his foundation when the ſtars be well affected, the inhabitants ſhall have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous and quiet living: if when the ſtarres be evil diſpoſed, then trouble and diſquietneſſe. They have no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:121621:137"/>of this, but that onely which is moſt falſe, for they know not the foundations of cities and towns, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the poſitions of the Stars when they were built. Let <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Venice</hi> be examples, becauſe theſe are moſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged of Aſtrologers, the time in which they were built is uncertain, and the Planets are falſly ſet in the figure of the foundation of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe <hi>Mercury</hi> is contrary to the <hi>Sun,</hi> a thing flat impoſſible. Again the folly of this is thus manifeſt, that an houſe, or city, or common-wealth may remain, the people being gone, as it is in the time of plague, and baniſhment, and conqueſts of Princes: And the inhabitants alſo may be ſafe and remain, the building quite ranſumed, and beaten down, as we may ſee in <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> the people and common-wealth remained, the Citie quite defaced. That all elections are unlawfull, Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> wrighting unto <hi>Januarius,</hi> proveth it forth of the fourth to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> by theſe words: <hi>Ye obſerve moneths and times and years</hi> (Therefore ſaith he) <hi>let us not obſerve dayes, and years, and moneths, and times, leſt we hear this of the Apoſtles: I am afraid leſt</hi> I <hi>have taken labour in vain with you:</hi> for he rebuketh them which ſay, I will not go, becauſe the Moon is thus or thus moved, or I will take my journey that I may have good ſucceſſe, becauſe there is ſuch a poſition of Stars: I will not do my buſineſſe this moneth, becauſe ſuch a Star governeth this moneth: or I will do my buſineſſe this moneth becauſe ſuch a Star ruleth. How then ſhall a man do, not to break the word of God? Art thou a man that deſireſt to lead a Chriſtian life? Then take the example of <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 1.10. as a pattern to govern all the actions of thy life: <hi>without ceaſing</hi> (ſaith he) I <hi>make mention of you in my prayers: beſeeching that by ſome means, one time or other</hi> I <hi>might have proſerous journey by the will of God to come unto you.</hi> So thou if thou haſt any buſineſſe in hand, any journey to take, any thing to buy or ſell, or any other matter: never
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:121621:137"/>regard the conſtellations of Heaven, commit thy ſelf to the onely providence of God, in whom thou haſt thy life, and motion, and being, who directeth all thy ſteps: pray unto him privately with thy ſelf to bleſſe thee and all thy actions, that they may tend to his glory, thy wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare: thou ſhalt find that all thy enterpriſes will have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſucceſſe, then if the whole hoaſt of heaven, and all the Prognoſticatours of England had promiſed never ſo much proſperity. Now let us ſhew their abſurd folly in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoſticating of the ſtate of the yeare: of which their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions are either generall for the whole yeare, or ſpeciall for every day. In their generall predictions are conſidered either the grounds of them or the matters which they fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell. Their grounds are eſpecially two. 1. The figure of the revolution of the yeare, erected when the Sun entreth the firſt minute of Aries. 2. The figure celeſtiall for the time of the Eclipſe of the Sun and Moon: for upon theſe twain, ſay they, dependeth the whole ſtate of the yeare. In their celeſtiall figures they conſider the erecting of them, and the finding of the Lord of the figure. The erecting of the figure, containeth very many abſurdities.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. They follow that way, which <hi>Regiomontanus</hi> did invent, never as yet proved by any experience, and flatly differing from thoſe wayes which of ancient Aſtrologers were uſed: and were invented by <hi>Gazulus</hi> and <hi>Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> Nay oftentimes it maketh the Planet or fixed Star to ſignifie a flat contrary thing to that which theſe two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. The caſting of the heavens into twelve parts, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying twelve diſtinct kind of matters is ridiculous, becauſe it being imagined, and void of ſtars, can have no force. Yet (ſome will ſay) other ſtars being in thoſe places may have and ſignifie ſuch or ſuch effects. I anſwer, that if Starres of divers natures coming to ſuch an houſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſignifying ſome one kind of thing, then the houſe muſt of neceſſity give ſome force unto the Planet: and
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:121621:138"/>ſo it ſhall have not onely an augmenting, but alſo an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually working power, which Aſtrologers deny, and no reaſon can prove.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. They make the twelfth and eleventh houſes being higher above the horizon then the firſt, to be of leſſe force then it: and the fourth houſe to be of greater power then any above the Horizon not Cardivall: and the end of the ninth to be more in power then the beginning of the eleventh houſe: all which are againſt reaſon, becauſe a Planet the more perpendicular his beams are, the more is his force. They anſwer, although the force of the light be greater, yet the ſecret influence is leſſe, and the firſt houſe hath more forcible influence then the twelfth or ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth. If the influence be ſecret how can they know it? again, they can by no good experience ſhew that thoſe houſes have more influence then the reſt: this influence maketh againſt them. I ſay they cannot prognoſticate becauſe they know not one ſtars virtue. For whereas they ſay, that the Sunne, and Moon and Planets have moſt force. I anſwer that it is by reaſon of their light, not their influence, which is ſmall, and there is far greater in the ſmalleſt fixed Stars. So that the fixed Stars al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have no light, or very ſmall light per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, yet they have moſt influence. And ſo theſe men muſt needs dream becauſe they judge by wrong cauſes. Well, their figure being framed and diſtinguiſhed with fair characters, then go they on to find the Lord of the figure, that is, that Planet which hath moſt dignitie in the figure.</p>

                              <p>Theſe toyes be ſo fooliſh that a reaſonable man would not vouchſafe to refute them: yet a word or twain. If the houſes of the Planets ſhall be batter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and puld down, all the reſt of their worſhip and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity will lye in the duſt. Aries and Scorpius are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the houſes of Mars, Taurus and Libra the houſes of Venus, Gemini and Virgo the houſes of Mercury: Cancer the houſe of the Moon, Leo the houſe of the Sunne, Sagittarius and Piſces the houſes of Jupiter, Aquarius and Capricornus the houſes of Saturn. What reaſon do they give of this? Leo and Cancer, ſay they, are the houſes of the Sun and Moon, becauſe they reſemble the nature of theſe Planets, and becauſe they come moſt near our heads: ſuch reaſon they give of the reſt. What feeble grounds are theſe: As in the North part of the World Cancer and Leo reſemble the nature of the Sunne: ſo in the South part, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Climats, Capricornus and Aquarius do reſemble their natures. Alſo in every countrey ſome divers ſigns be either verticall, or elſe come near the top of the countrey; and ſo all ſigns ſhall be the houſes of the Sun and Moon. Now then, the Sun being diſplaced, I cannot find how the reſt of the Planets can keep their hold. To
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:121621:139"/>go further, the exaltations of <hi>Planets</hi> in like manner are the very dreams. They ſuppoſe <hi>Exaltations</hi> be thoſe degrees in which the <hi>Planets</hi> were in the beginning of the world. But why ſhould thoſe places give more force then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? And if they could give more force, yet they have falſly aſſigned them. For the <hi>Sun</hi> was not in <hi>Aries</hi> when it was created of God, but was placed in <hi>Libra,</hi> which I prove by this reaſon. God created Man and Beaſt in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect age, giving unto them all kinds of fruits being then ripe, ſo that in the beginning was the time of the year, which we call Harveſt. Now, becauſe God never after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward changed the Seaſons, and we find that in the time of ripeneſſe the <hi>Sunne</hi> is alwayes in <hi>Libra,</hi> we muſt needs alſo ſay that his place in the creation was in <hi>Libra.</hi> In the 23. of <hi>Exodus</hi> God commandeth that the Feaſt of Tabernacles ſhould be celebrated in the end of the year when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had gathered their fruits out of the fields. Wherefore it muſt needs be that Harveſt was in the beginning of the yeare (the beginning and ending being both together) and ſo by count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing backwards we ſhall finde that the <hi>Sunne</hi> was in <hi>Libra</hi> in the beginning of the World.

                              <p>The reſt of the dignities of the <hi>Planets</hi> conſiſt of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples more weak then water. Firſt, what is more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable to a reaſonable man then this, that ſwift moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould give unto a <hi>Planet</hi> two dignities, and ſlow mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion two debilities,: it ſeemeth to be plain contrary. For a ſwift courſe hindereth the force of the <hi>Planet,</hi> a flow courſe helpeth the ſame: and the ſtations of any <hi>Planet</hi> make an effectuall and ſenſible operation. A cole of fire in a mans hand if it be ſhaken about very much, it heateth very little, if it be ſhaken more ſlowly, it heateth more: but if it ly ſtill, it burneth violently. Beſide this, alſo
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:121621:139"/>experience confirmeth my Aſſertion. In the year of our Lord 1513. the <hi>Sun</hi> entering into <hi>Piſces</hi> was almoſt in <hi>Trine Aſpect</hi> with <hi>Saturn</hi> ſtationary, a little while after, there was a great Froſt and Snow continuing many dayes: and when <hi>Saturn</hi> began again to be direct, the Weather was indifferent warm. In the year 1518. In <hi>April Jupiter</hi> almoſt <hi>in ſecunda ſtatione</hi> beholding <hi>Saturn in ſtatione prima</hi> cauſed a great heat, conſidering the time of the year. In the year 1520. <hi>Saturn</hi> (as I ſaid before) being ſtationary made ſuch a cold, that ſpoiled the Grapes, and made Wine dear. Upon theſe Examples, and many other I may conclude, that the work and influence of Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, is moſt felt when they are ſtationary; becauſe their virtue is fixed (as it were) in one place by reaſon of the ſlow motion.</p>

                                 <hi>Combustion</hi> is in like ſort a feigned thing, What reaſon can <hi>Astrologers</hi> give, why it ſhould give unto a ſtar 5 debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities? They talk how that experience teacheth them, that Planets being under the beams of the <hi>Sun</hi> do loſe a great, nay (ſome ſay) all their force. It is a manifeſt untruth. For, <hi>Mercury</hi> being of the nature of that Planet with which he is conjoyned, if he go from conjunction with <hi>Saturn</hi> unto the <hi>Sun,</hi> he getteth no debilities thereby, but rather loſing the feeble and unfortunate nature of <hi>Saturn,</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a more ſtrong and fortunate nature of the <hi>Sun.</hi> If any man ſay againſt me that <hi>Mercury</hi> combuſt hath no force, he deceiveth himſelf. For if he be not hindered, he naturally will cauſe Windes, being combuſt he not onely engendreth Windes, but cauſeth tempeſtuous Windes and foul Weather.

Again, when many days together there hath been fair wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the <hi>Sun</hi> if it come to be in conjunction or any other Aſpect with <hi>Saturn</hi> maketh very foul Weather, and therefore the Aſpects of the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> are called,

                              <p>Theſe and ſuch like proceed onely from the will of man: the Conſtellations of ſtars are neither ſignes nor Cauſes of them. Some will ſay <hi>Non imponere neceſſitatem, ſed incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare Stellas,</hi> that is, That ſtars do not conſtrain, but onely incline the mindes of men: a moſt wicked ſaying, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though moſt commonly ſpoken of, and defended. For the inclining of the will of man is onely the work of God, as the holy Scriptures do teach us, <hi>The heart of man</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) purpoſeth his ways, but the Lord directeth his ſteps:</hi> Prov. 1.6, 9. <hi>O Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Jeremy</hi> the Prophet) <hi>that the way of man, is not in himſelf, neither is it in man to walk, and direct his ſteps:</hi> Jer. 10.23. He ſpeaketh this, becauſe that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> purpoſed to have made
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:121621:141"/>war againſt the <hi>Moabites</hi> and <hi>Amonites,</hi> but hearing of <hi>Zedekiahs</hi> Rebellion he turned his power to go againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> therefore the Prophet ſaith, that whereas he had otherwiſe purpoſed, yet this was the Lords inclination and direction. Again, in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> we reade this; <hi>that the heart of the King is in the hands of the Lord, as the Rivers of water he directeth it whether he will. Prov.</hi> 21.1 It will be ſaid, that although God properly and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately inclineth the will of man: yet alſo ſome ſmall inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be given unto the Stars, and that immediately.

                              <p>The deceits and untruths which be in their Reaſons, are very many.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. The ſtars work upon mens bodies, yet ſo that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Countrey and Soil, the Meats and Drinks have moſt commonly greater force. Why are the bodies of Gentlemen of <hi>England</hi> and poor labouring men of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers diſpoſitions? Are they not both in one Countrey? Do not the Stars ſhew their force in them alike? Yes truly, but the kinde of life and diet prevaileth. In the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:121621:141"/>why are they, which dwell upon hills, of other temperatures then they, which dwell upon plain and cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion ground? why do not the ſame influences of Starrs make them of like natures? is it not becauſe the nature of the ſoil prevaileth: So then, when as there be many cauſes effectuall, and differing in altering mens bodies, to build an argument upon one cauſe is moſt unreaſonable.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. The ſtarrs work upon the Elements earth, water, air, by making heat, cold, moiſture, drineſs. The ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, how work they on mens bodies: They will alſo ſay by making heat, cold, moiſture, drineſſe: which is moſt untrue: for the hotter and dryer the Elements be, the colder and moiſture by nature are mens bodies. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſaying of <hi>Empedocles:</hi> Nature placed a hot Body in a cold Countrey, and a cold Body in a hot Countrey.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. The <hi>Philoſophers</hi> ſay that all cauſes are either <hi>per ſe</hi> or <hi>per accidens,</hi> Now the heavens being cauſes of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the ſenſes <hi>per accidens,</hi> they muſt not be cauſes of the inclination of the will, either <hi>per ſe</hi> or <hi>per accidens,</hi> but <hi>per accidentis, accidens,</hi> which is moſt ridiculous,</p>
                              <p n="4">4. This long chain by which they link the will of man to the ſtarrs, if it ſhall be applied unto particulars it muſt needs break: for the actions of the will is buying, ſelling, travailing, lying, heaping up wealth, murdering, ſpreading of fals ruomrs, offering of diſcourteſies, hating of kinsfolks, and ſuch like, which our Heaven-gazers foretell, have no coherent with the firſt qualities, heat, cold, moiſture, dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: neither can they any way proceed from them, and therefore the ſtars cannot be cauſes of them, for they work onely by theſe qualities.</p>
                              <p n="5">5. This reaſon is nothing to their purpoſe: for becauſe they grant that a man may freely reſiſt the inclination of the ſtarrs, and he may hinder that, unto which the ſtarrs bend his will, how dare they preſume to ſay this or that will come to paſs. The heathen men gave up themſelves to
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:121621:142"/>their own luſts and vanities and followed every little and vain inclination: and of them, in this order, did ancient <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> among them divine that this or that time, ſuch actions, ſuch vices, ſuch enterpriſes, ſuch affaires ſhould be among them. In like manner our <hi>Engliſh</hi> wiſe men, ſpeak of us as though we were beaſts, not reaſonable men, as though we never heard the bleſſed Goſpel of God, never taſted of the grace of God, never learned what is good and what is bad, never laboured to ſubdue our luſts and affections, alwayes turned too and fro with the blaſt of any influence, working very ſlenderly in us.</p>
                              <p>Thus much of Civil Affaires. They make mention alſo yearly of the diſeaſes which ſhall reign: but the way which they follow, is taken forth of the barren and uncertain rules of the old <hi>Aſtrologers,</hi> who do ſo aſcribe unto every Planet certain Diſeaſes, that if need ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite, they may referre the ſame diſeaſe unto any ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catours, as in the Plague, the putrefaction of humours is attributed unto <hi>Jupiter;</hi> the ſharp Feaver unto <hi>Mars,</hi> the madneſſe which followeth unto <hi>Mercury,</hi> the whole Plague unto <hi>Mars.</hi> In the Pluriſie the inflammation of the bloud between the skin called <hi>Pluritis,</hi> and the ribbs is attributed unto <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the ſuppuration of the Bloud unto <hi>Saturn,</hi> and the whole Pluriſie unto <hi>Jupiter,</hi> In the Jaundies the inflammation and corruption of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, unto <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the yelow humour in the gaul, unto <hi>Mars,</hi> the obſtruction of the parts unto <hi>Saturn</hi> the whole Jaundies being white, unto <hi>Mars,</hi> blak, unto <hi>Saturn.</hi> And ſo in every diſeaſe, they uſe this inconſtancy and ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity in <hi>Prognoſticating.</hi> It is a rule among the <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> that if the Planets ſignifiers of diſeaſes be well affected, then there ſhall be no diſeaſes but health: if they be evilly affected, then diſeaſes follow. Our <hi>Prognoſticatours</hi> never mark this rule but howſoever the Planets be affected they ſtraightwayes pronounce that ſuch diſeaſes ſhall reign. For example the laſt winter quarter, it was ſaid by one of
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:121621:142"/>them, that the diſeaſes which ſhould afflict mens bodies were rheums, coughs, cold lasks, ſwelling of the face and throat, falling of the Colmel, ſore eyes, deafneſs, the ſtone, gout, dropſie, green-ſickneſs. madneſs, quartern feavers. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And all the Planets, ſignifiers of diſeaſes in the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were indifferent well affected: wherfore thou haſt not one cauſe to fear their threatnings, but rather to be ſorry for their continuall deceits, wiſhing them minds that they may one day ſee their own folly.</p>
                              <p>Concerning the time when the conſtellations take their effects, our <hi>Prognoſticatours</hi> ſay that ſome take their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, the ſame year, ſome not the ſame year but long after, as great Conjunctions and Eclipſes, for they ſay if the Moon be eclipſed one hour, ſhe worketh her effect a moneth after, if two hours, two moneths after: and the Sunn for every hour it is eclipſed taketh his effect an whole year after. Truely this rule which they follow, muſt needs be againſt all reaſon. For why ſhould not all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions and oppoſitions of the Sunne and Moon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerre their effects as well as thoſe conjuctions and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions in which the Sunne and Moon is eclipſed? if they ſhow forth their power immediatly after, why ſhould not theſe alſo do the ſame? Moreover the Epignoſticall <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> who have conferred the courſe of the heavens, with Hiſtories, ſhew very manifeſtly, that Eclipſes do not deferr the time of working their ſpite upon the Earth.</p>
                              <p>In the year of our Lord 1419, the Sunne was Ecli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſed in <hi>Aries,</hi> and preſently after ſhewed all his force. There was a great ſedition in <hi>Prague</hi> that year: In <hi>Paris</hi> an uprore between them of the Citty and the Univerſity, and two thouſand Schollars were ſlain, then alſo <hi>Wenze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaus</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> being in a great Palſie dyed. In the year 1524. There was a conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Scorpius</hi> and alſo a great eclipſe of the Sunne in June, which took their effects the ſame year: <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> driven forth of his Countrey: warre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:121621:143"/>
                                 <hi>Danes</hi> and the men of <hi>Sleſwick.</hi> There was a great plague in <hi>Germany,</hi> Civil diſſention amongſt the Princes of the Empire, and them which took the part of <hi>John Huſſe.</hi> 1452. An eclipſe of the Sunne in <hi>Sagit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarius,</hi> his effects began preſently, and laſted a great while: Even then <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was taken by the <hi>Turke.</hi> The <hi>Hungarians</hi> and <hi>Bohemians</hi> beſieged <hi>Frederick</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. 1473. the 27. of April: the Sunne was eclipſed in <hi>Taurus Mars</hi> being in <hi>Aries</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Sagittari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi> The ſame year in Summer was ſuch heat and drineſs of weather, that woods even withered, and one might wade over deep rivers. In the years of our Lord. 1476. 1460. 1469. 1486. 1502. 1518. And many years after their were both great conjunctions, and ſtrange ecli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſes, which took their effects preſently, not one, or two, or three years after (as our heaven-gazers bear them in hard). All theſe examples which I bring againſt them, I have not feigned, but taken forth of thoſe books which they have in greateſt eſtimation, and could, if need ſhould ſerve, bring an hundred more, all to ſhew their lies when as they commonly ſay thus, <q>There ſhall be an Eclipſe this year, marry I will not here determine his effects, but reſerve them to be declared in my <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoſtication</hi> one year or two years hence, when it will take place.</q>
                              </p>
                              <p>To know where the effects of the ſtarrs ſhall take place, they have appointed unto every ſigne certain coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes, as over <hi>Europe</hi> they have ſet the fiery <hi>Triplicitie,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Orientall and North parts of the <hi>Aſia</hi> the airy <hi>Triplicity:</hi> the watery <hi>Triplicity</hi> over <hi>Africa,</hi> over the South parts of the <hi>Aſia</hi> the earthy <hi>Triplicity:</hi> and ſo every peculiar ſigne hath his dominion over ſome parts of thoſe. Now therefore, when a conjunction or eclipſe is in any of theſe ſignes the Cities and Countryes ſubject unto them feel the force of that conſtellation eſpecially. This is a moſt manifeſt untruth and may be confuted by many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:121621:143"/>1. The nature of the ſigns is not the ſame now as it was in times paſt and by the confeſſion of the beſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed have other effects. now, then they had in the days of King <hi>Ptolomy:</hi> yet we ſee the nature of Countryes and people to remain the ſame ſtill, as may be ſeen by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Tacitus, Plime, Caſar, Strabo.</hi> 2. <hi>America</hi> which is half the world, hath no ſigns appointed over it: why? it was found out of late. True it is, but this is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the Rules of <hi>Astrology,</hi> are abſurd, and were the bare inventions and imaginations of idle brains, For, there is no doubt, but that <hi>America</hi> his parts and I lands as Breſilea, Peru, Pari, Terra Florida, Java Major, Java Minor, Puloana, Pavilonga, Subath, Maſſana, Mattan, Juvacana, Cozumella Jamaica <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have felt the force of theſe Conſtellations, which they attribute to ſome parts of the old world. Becauſe theſe Countreys be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle <hi>Zone,</hi> and have both Planets and ſigns full over them, and therefore if the Starrs threaten any ſtrange thing to come, they muſt eſpecially feel it. 3. Experience the cauſe of all acts is againſt them, as is manifeſt in theſe examples. 47. years before the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of our Saviour Chriſt there was a Conjunction of the higher Planets in <hi>Scorpius.</hi> and then was civil warre between <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey:</hi> And the change of the Empire was in <hi>Europe.</hi> But according to the inſtitution of <hi>Astrologers</hi> all theſe troubles ſhould have been in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick,</hi> becauſe <hi>Scorpius</hi> hath his dominion there. In the year of our Lord. 34. there was a great Conjunction of Planets in <hi>Leo,</hi> and then (faith one very prophanely) was the Goſpel preached through the world, But if he make this Conjunction to be a ſign of the preaching of the Goſpel, then it ſhould more have been preached in the parts of <hi>Europe</hi> then <hi>Aſia,</hi> which is not true. In the years of our Lord. 331. and 1127. There were great Conjunctions in <hi>Virgo,</hi> and yet the Countryes ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to this ſignſelt no harm, but <hi>Italy</hi> was troubled with
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:121621:144"/>the <hi>Popes</hi> ſuperſtitions, and <hi>Arrius</hi> his hereſie broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. There was a meeting of Planets in <hi>Sagittarius.</hi> 73. years after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when as <hi>Otho, Galba, vitel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> and <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> troubled the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, yet there was no where more grievous warres then in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine,</hi> and no greater ſlaughter then of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who are ſubject unto <hi>Scorpius</hi> and not unto <hi>Sagittarius,</hi> In the year 1464. a Conjunction of higher Planers was in <hi>Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> under whoſe dominion, although <hi>Europe</hi> be not plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet it moſt felt the ſmart by troubles and civil warrs. So 1576. and 1577. Two eclipſes of the Sun, the one in <hi>Leo,</hi> the other in <hi>Capricorn,</hi> took their effects in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many:</hi> when as <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Capricorn</hi> do not rule that Countrey. It is vain to ſhew the abſurdity of this rule by more examples, theſe ſhall be ſufficient.</p>
                              <p>This ſhall ſuffice to have ſpoken of their generall <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,</hi> now follow their ſpeciall determinations of the ſtate and temperance of the weather, wherein I will ſet forth firſt of all a moſt manifeſt and abſurd contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which moſt of them make, and that is this. They uſe (as I have ſaid) to ſet down their judgements of the whole quarter, that it ſhould be either moiſt, hot, cold, or dry: afterward judging particularly they diſprove by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular dayes that which they ſaid before. In the year of our Lord. 1581. one ſaid that in the Autumn quarter ſhould be a great drought, yet I peruſing his particular judements upon the dayes of the quarter, I find it ſhould have plenty of rain. In the year laſt paſt another ſaid, the ſummer ſhould be ſo hot and dry that wells and rivers ſhould be dried up, and fiſhes be ſcarce, and Cattel dy for want of water: yea the ſame party in his particular judgement of the weather, maketh 20. dayes of the ſame quarter, at the leaſt rain and miſling, and 30. other either temperate or very cold.</p>
                              <p>In one word, the judgements which are ſet down, of the weather, they are more tolerable then the reſt: yet as long as the wold endureth, no man ſhall be able to
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:121621:144"/>
                                 <hi>prognoſticate</hi> truely what weather ſhall be in every day of the year. The cauſes of this I have ſet down before, and need not now to repeat. Wherefore they might leave of any longer to buſie themſelves in this kind. And it ſhall be ſufficient for thee, leading a chriſtian life, to know the generall and ordinary eſtate of the parts and ſeaſons of the year.</p>
                              <p>

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:121621:147"/>Conſtellations of the Heaven, is by reaſon of their forms and particular virtues, expreſſed under theſe figures; for <hi>Ptolomy</hi> hath delivered the nature of the particular ſtars in them by themſelves, as alſo their <hi>particular Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>efficacies,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Houſes, exaltations, triplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, terms,</hi> and <hi>faces,</hi> and other <hi>Dignities,</hi> of the ſignes, as they follow the nature of the Planets: and ſince theſe are known, to what end are all theſe his Cavils, whether there be a ninth or tenth Sphere? for let there be none at all (as he ſaith) nor any think called a Zodiack (as he would fain perſwade the World) yet ſince clear experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and practice evinceth him, as alſo demonſtration that there are ſuch Conſtellations (call them what you will) his ſophiſtical weak Argument will no wiſe ſerve his turn; for I may as well deny there is a <hi>Dog</hi> a <hi>Bear,</hi> both leſſer and bigger, a <hi>Swan,</hi> a <hi>Crown,</hi> a <hi>Waggoner,</hi> and the like; as he denieth there is not a <hi>Bull,</hi> a <hi>Ram</hi> or a <hi>Lion</hi> in the Heavens, when it is not deſired literally (by any Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger) to be underſtood: <g ref="char:dtristar">*⁎*</g> that not proved.</p>
                  <p>SURVEY. Firſt, that men may ſee whether <hi>Will. Ram.</hi> hath not been impertinent in his Anſwer, we will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the Doctours third Argument.</p>
                  <p>The fourth and laſt Argument (ſaith the Doctour) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Aſtrology that I ſhall urge, paſſing by innumerable others, is, that a main part of the <hi>Baſis,</hi> and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, on which Aſtrologers build the ſtructure of their Art of Prediction is but meet imagination: for there is no ſuch thing as the tenth or ninth Sphere: and therefore the Zodiack placed by Aſtrologers in them is but a dreamed Fiction. Yea, and one of the <hi>quondam</hi> great Aſtrologers (M. P.) will dare to ſay, that <q>the twelve Signes, bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (as they ſuppoſe) within the dimenſions of ſuch a thing as a Zodiack; namely, the ſignes of <hi>Aries, Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Gemini, &amp;c.</hi> that is, a <hi>Ram,</hi> a <hi>Bull, &amp;c.</hi> (feigned to have power over the twelve parts of Man's Body) are onely twelve imaginary Signes; for in the Heavens
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:121621:147"/>(ſaith he) there is no ſuch matter as a <hi>Ram,</hi> a <hi>Bull, &amp;c.</hi> And how (ſaith he) can it ſtand with reaſon, that in a Firmament, <hi>feigned</hi> by <hi>Poets,</hi> and <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> a <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</hi> Sign (which indeed is nothing) ſhould have any power and operation in the Bodies of men. Again, the very order of Government of theſe Signes in Man's bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, is found and without ſhew of reaſon: for according to this Platform, when the Moon cometh into the firſt Sign <hi>Aries,</hi> ſhe ruleth in the head; and when ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the ſecond Sign <hi>Taurus,</hi> ſhe ruleth in the Neck; and ſo deſcends down from part to part, ruling two, in ſome three dayes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where obſerve (ſaith he) that the Moon is made to rule in the cold and moiſt parts, when ſhe is in the hot and dry Signes; whereas in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a more conſonant order were this, that when the Moon were in hot and dry Signes, as in <hi>Aries, Leo,</hi> and <hi>Sagittarius,</hi> ſhe ſhould rule in hot and dry parts of the body; and when ſhe is in cold and moiſt Signes, ſhe ſhould rule in the cold and moiſt parts of the Body; and ſo ſtill govern thoſe parts which in temperature come neareſt to the Signes wherein the Moon is. Beſide this, ſome learned Phyſicians have upon experience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that <hi>the obſervation of the Sign is nothing mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi> and that there is no danger in it, for gelding of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, or letting of bloud. And the vanity of the old con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit and imagination of them that have put much in the Signes, appears in the common practice of men, who commonly upon <hi>Stevens</hi> day uſe to let bloud, be the Sign where it will. The truth is (ſaith he) the Sign in its own nature is neither way available, being but a <hi>phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie,</hi> grounded upon <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> premiſes, and therefore ought to be rejected as meer <hi>Vanity.</hi>

                  <p>Firſt, touching thoſe <hi>feigned Firmaments,</hi> or Heavens, called the ninth and tenth Heavens; beſides that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient famous Aſtronomers, <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle Hipparchus,</hi> and many others, knew no ſuch thing; ſenſe alſo doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince that we can be ſure of no more but eight: For we ſee diſtinctly the ſeven Planets, Sun, Moon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and their ſeveral motions in twenty four hours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And we can perceive the eighth Heaven of the fixed ſtars (known by their twinkling) to move in one motion, round the Earth in 24. hours; becauſe we can ſee the heels of the leſſer <hi>Northern Bear;</hi> adjacent to the North Pole, to be down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward towards the Earth in the Evening, and to be upward in the Morning. But we have no ſure ground to conclude that there are more Heavens, either the <hi>Chryſtall Ninth,</hi> or the <hi>first moving Tenth.</hi> The grand reaſon brought to prove them from the two other motions of the eighth Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of fixed ſtars beſide that from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt</hi> in twenty four hours, as that the eighth Heaven of fixed ſtars moves from <hi>Weſt</hi> to <hi>Eaſt,</hi> coming to be in the ſame poſture as when they began that motion, by the end of forty nine thouſand years: and that the ſame eighth Heaven hath another motion from <hi>South</hi> to <hi>North,</hi> and thence to <hi>South</hi> again, which proceſs and receſs is a finiſhing ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years; and therefore that that motion of the eighth Heaven, from <hi>East</hi> to <hi>West</hi> in 24. hours, muſt needs be <hi>violent,</hi> as forced from ſome <hi>tenth</hi> Heaven, naturally ſo moving; and that from <hi>Weſt</hi> to <hi>Eaſt</hi> in forty nine thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, muſt be alſo violent, as forced from ſome ninth Heaven, naturally ſo moving; and the laſt motion of the eighth Heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> From <hi>South</hi> to <hi>North,</hi> and back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in ſeven thouſand years to be the natural, peculiar, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate motion of that eighth Heaven; ſeeing that (as they forme the Argument) one ſimple ſingle moveable body can have but one natural motion; I ſay; this Argument doth not evince my reaſon in the leaſt, to believe the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence and being of the ninth and tenth Heaven: for God
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:121621:148"/>that by his Word at the beginning ſaid to the Earth, <hi>Stand thou ſtill,</hi> and to the Sea, <hi>Move thou continually,</hi> with ſeverall motions, as of flowing and reflowing, twice every twenty four hours, and they obey his voice to this day; the ſame God commanding the eighth Heaven to run from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>West</hi> every twenty four hours; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to linger and ſlinck back every day a little from <hi>Weſt</hi> to <hi>Eaſt</hi> (as ſuppoſe with the Aſtronomer) as much as comes to one Degree, or ſixty miles in an hundred years (which is about three quarters of a mile in one year and half a quarter) and alſo to roul forward from <hi>South</hi> to <hi>North,</hi> and back again from <hi>North</hi> to <hi>South,</hi> ſo gradually till in ſeven hundred years it is as it was, cannot chuſe but obey the voice of God; and ſo move without ceaſing. And (to throw away Traditions in Philoſophy as well as in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity) 'tis a readier way and ſurer, to ſay, God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Heavens ſo to move at firſt Creation, and they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey; then to ſay, <hi>Primus motor</hi> God moves the Angels, or Intelligences, they move a tenth Heaven, and a tenth Heaven moves the other Heavens. And to the clauſe of one natural body, we ſay, that there is hardly any natural motion, without ſome violent, as the Philoſophers calls violent: for if Fire aſcends, no more of the flame aſcends in a pure natural motion, but that which aſcends in the Mathematical indiviſible Line in the point of the <hi>Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis,</hi> pointing at the Centre-point of the Earth, to its cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent point in the Sphere of the loweſt Heaven. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if the Pyramical form of the flame were turned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide down, then all the flakes of flame might ſeem to take their natural order proportionable from one Centre-point in the Earth, to their ſeveral correſpondent points in the Sphere of the loweſt Heaven.</p>
                  <p>So of any heavy Body, Stone, or Bowl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> falling down from ſome high places to the Earth, no more of it moves naturally, then the very middle of it tending down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in a Mathematical ſtrait Line to the Centre-point of
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:121621:149"/>the Earth; the corners of ſuch a ſtone, or the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of that Bowl, falling not with the like natural mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe there is but one univerſal Centre-point in the middle of the Earth, to anſwer to all downward motions; which is the Phyſical demonſtrative reaſon why naturally the Earth is round, the heavy parts more preſſing to the general Centre-point, the lighter leſſer.</p>
                  <p>So the Water in its motion in a River, it naturally tends downward, yet deſires not to be ſo low as the Centre of the Earth: and the mean while it tends progreffively forward; and in this progreſſive motion, no more is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely natural, but what proceeds in a ſtrait Line: for the Water hath no minde of it ſelf to go out of its Line; that being out of its way, and beſides its deſign. So that either we muſt ſay, one man may have many natural mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or we muſt no more feign more Heavens then eight, to move the reſt, in their ſeveral motions, then we dare feign more Elements then four, to manage the ſeveral mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are in each one of them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, touching the imaginary Sphere the Zodiack, this muſt needs be an infallible Concluſion, ſo far as the Heaven or Firmament of the Zodiack is feigned, ſo far of neceſſity muſt the Zodiack ſuppoſed in that Heaven or Firmament be a meer feigned thing. (We heard afore, that moſt learned Philoſopher and Aſtronomer <hi>Kecker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> lay it down for a ſure Rule; that Aſtronomers may make, and uſe <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> that is, Suppoſitions, but Aſtrologers may not.) But the ninth or tenth Sphere or Heaven are feigned, therefore the Zodiack imagined in them is alſo ſeigned. 'Tis worth the while to hear <hi>Alſted</hi> (which is to our purpoſe) what he ſaith concerning the Zodiack, the Zodiack (ſaith he) of the firſt Mover (that is the tenth Heaven) is <hi>imaginary,</hi> of the eighth Sphere real. The imaginary is primarily and <hi>originally</hi> in the Mover, or tenth Heaven, in the inferiour Spheres it is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily <hi>conceited.</hi> The Real changeth its ſituation; the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:121621:149"/>
                     <hi>imaginary</hi> doth not. The ſignes alſo of the real Zodiack, are wonderfull <hi>unequal,</hi> but in the <hi>imaginary</hi> equal. In Accounts the imaginary Zodiack is more commodious; but not ſo in Predictions. Thus you ſee how much <hi>fiction</hi> there is about the Zodiack; and more honour aſcribed to the feigned then to the real.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, touching the twelve imaginary Signes; there is no ſuch formes of ſtars, as of themſelves ſeem ſuch. Compare <hi>Taurus</hi> and <hi>Aries;</hi> and <hi>Aries</hi> lying under <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laena.</hi> Tradition and Globes tell us ſuch things, but the ſtars of themſelves could never make us ſo imagine. See the Celeſtial Globe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, touching the diſorderly placing of the hot dry Signes in parts that are not hot and dry: Nore that <hi>Alſted</hi> a learned Philoſopher, and was alſo an Aſtrologer, (at leaſt in opinion) affirms in his Syſtem, or Treatiſe of <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> that the twelve Signes are divided into four <hi>Trigonos,</hi> that is Ternions. or Three. <hi>In primo trigono ſunt ſignaignea, videlicet, Aries, Leo, &amp; Sagittarius: In his dominantur calor &amp; ſiccitas, quae dominantur cholerae &amp; ſapori amaro:</hi> that is, In the firſt Ternion are the fiery Signes. <hi>Aries</hi> the Ram, <hi>Leo</hi> the Lion, and <hi>Sagittarius</hi> the Archer. In theſe Signes are predominant heat and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which have dominion and rule over Choller, and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs: ſo <hi>Alſted, Vranoſc. Par.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. Now that theſe Signes are thus affigned to have dominion; <hi>Aries</hi> on the <hi>head,</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> on the <hi>heart,</hi> and <hi>Sagittarius</hi> on the <hi>Reins</hi> and <hi>Loyns,</hi> your Aſtrologers ſhew you in your ordinary and common <hi>Almanacks.</hi> But your Philoſophers and Phyſicians will aſſure us upon ſtrong reaſon, that a man hath the coldeſt Brain, and moiſteſt Heart, and humid'ſt Reins.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, touching the imagined Signes, and their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed dominion over the parts of Man's Body, this would be taken into conſideration, that the Traditions about them is ſuch a Fiction in the eyes of ſome Aſtrologers, that
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:121621:150"/>ſome of them omit them in their Almanacks, others ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly deride them. So that which goes under the name of Maſter <hi>Pond:</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>Should I but dare to omit the Anatomy,</l>
                        <l>Which long enough hath gull'd my Countrey Friend:</l>
                        <l>He with contempt would ſtraight refuſe to buy</l>
                        <l>This Book; and 'tis no <hi>Almanack</hi> contend:</l>
                        <l>Ask him its uſe, hee'll ſay he cannot tell;</l>
                        <l>No more can I; yet ſince he love'st ſo well,</l>
                        <l>I le let it ſtand, becauſe my Book ſhall ſell.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for my part, I have of purpoſe tried the experiment of letting Bloud in that part where the Sign hath been (as the Almanacks preſcribe) with good ſucceſs. Thus the Doctour, which <hi>Will. Ram.</hi> hath in no meaſure anſwered, neither in quantity nor quality, either to M. <hi>Perkins,</hi> or <hi>Alſted,</hi> nor to the <hi>Doctour. Will Ram.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let there be no ninth or tenth Sphere.</hi> Then we ask what becomes of the <hi>Baſis</hi> of Aſtrology, ſeeing the Zodiack (ſuppoſed in them <hi>originally unchangeably,</hi> and <hi>equally</hi>) is thereby ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away. <hi>ret</hi> ſaith <hi>Will. Ram. the ſaid twelve Signes or Conſtellations are there, call them</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>what you will.</hi> But we have ſhewed <hi>Will. Ram.</hi> that <hi>they are not there;</hi> there is no ſuch Configurations. And therefore the Effects of ſuch Conſtellations <hi>as ſuch</hi> muſt needs be <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,</hi> as the Effects of any ſtars for the moſt are <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognita,</hi> and <hi>Will. Ram.</hi> hath not demonſtrated to the contrary; but onely <hi>Verba dare.</hi> And play'd the Dictator not Confutor; or as if he had been rather Jeſter on the Stage at <hi>Technogamia,</hi> then a Juridical Advocate at the diyorce of Aſtrology.</p>

               <head>W. R. his <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Wherein the Doctours confutation of the objections that are brought for Aſtrology is <hi>(he ſaith)</hi> examined and refuted.</head>
               <p>THere remains nothing more to be anſwered of Maſter <hi>Homes</hi> his diſcourſe but his confutations of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections that are brought for Aſtrology, which indeed is already refelled in what hath been already ſaid; having conſideration to the definition of Aſtrology, and the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents of Aſtrologers: but becauſe I wil not give him occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to carp or brag of my leaving him here, I ſhall go along with him in every particular of his remaining cavils; that ſo the Reader may ſee on what ſmall grounds he builds up his tower of oppoſition againſt Aſtrology, and what ſmall reaſon he hath to carp thereat.</p>
               <p>Firſt he ſaith <hi>Melancthon</hi> ſtandeth not for Aſtrology; but you have heard before how he alſo thus falſely abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Galen;</hi> but admit neither of all theſe were one jot for it, but poſitively againſt it; yet wil not this (if granted) make a whit againſt Aſtrology; ſince he will not deny but theſe are men, and <hi>humanum eſt errare, man is ſubject to frailty and errour,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not Aſtrology abſolutely condemned hereby; ſince already you have heard it no wiſe condemned by the word of God, but the effects of the Stars clearly thereby manifeſted; yet for the anſwer of this his deluſive quirk. I ſhall onely ſend him to <hi>Melancthon</hi> to be better peruſed (which here to clear would be too too tedious) and then he will not thus inconſiderately wrong him, as the other two S. <hi>Augustin</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> the reaſon whereof was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a negligent peruſall of them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ro gain-ſay (as he thinks) Aſtrology, he ſaith, <hi>that ſome make a great matter of the Star that
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:121621:151"/>was ſeen at the birth of Chriſt:</hi> But I anſwer, that this appearance of this Starre maketh neither for nor againſt Aſtrology.</p>
               <p>But to come to the objections Logicall, which he ſaith are brought in defence of Aſtrology and his anſwers, the firſt is, that <hi>God made the Stars to be ſigns,</hi> Gen. 1.14. <hi>therefore the knowledge of the ſignification of theſe ſigns are lawfull:</hi> his anſwer is, <hi>God made them to be ſigns of naturall effects or events, not of arbitrary and morall, that depend on mans will.</hi> Wherefore here firſt the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may take notice that M. <hi>Homes</hi> doth now (contrary to what he hath all this while denyed) conſeſſe the Stars to be ſigns of naturall effects and events, and whereas he denies them to be ſigns of arbitrary and morall events de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on the will, he gaineth little of the Aſtrologer, who (as you have already heard) acknowledgeth the ſame.</p>
               <p>To handle here every particular objection and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers hereon, would be too tedious, and indeed but vain, and to little purpoſe, ſince he can ſay no more then what hath been already (if rightly underſtood) anſwered: for to inſiſt upon every vain quillet were an <hi>Herculean la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> and to render my ſelf more weak then the propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders or authours thereof; wherefore I conclude.</p>

                  <head>The Doctours <hi>SECT. V.</hi> Confuting the Objections that are brought in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of Aſtrology.</head>
                  <p>I will not be ſo ſevere (unprovoked) as to take publick cognizance of, and to name to the world, the Authours Books, Predictions, or Practiſes that have apologized for,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:121621:151"/>and acted in Aſtrology; becauſe of other good learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them (which I reverence); though in their <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicalls,</hi> I know they have exceedingly erred. If any will be violently impertinent, <hi>Viis &amp; modis,</hi> by all means to lay low others perſons or parts, thereby to advance their miſtakes, the <hi>Defendent</hi> then is bound to tell <hi>All the Truth,</hi> which can be made good by ſubſtantiall witneſſes, and teſtimony. That which I have in my eye to do, is onely to give a light touch, and pointing with the finger upon ſome few things that are moſt ſpeciouſly pretended to be Patronages of Aſtrology.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe ſome are more <hi>Oratorious,</hi> others more <hi>Logicall.</hi> I ſhall ſuit my language to theirs. And to the firſt I muſt ſay, it appears by what hath been ſaid in the precedent Treatiſe, that <hi>The Heavens</hi> yet never ſpake the <hi>Language</hi> of Aſtrology, ſo as the moſt learned in the World (afore named) could ever underſtand. And to rhetoricate high in the behalf of <hi>Astronomy;</hi> or to kick down low them that ſlight it, is wide from the buſineſſe in hand touching <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> whoſe vaſt difference from the other was afore ſufficiently, though briefly, intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: And though he ſhould own it, that <hi>Pleyades, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturus, Orion,</hi> and <hi>other Stars</hi> (mentioned in Scripture, and allowed therein to be lawfully mentioned by us) have ſtampt in them by creation a power of <hi>Influences,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by accordingly they <hi>Operate</hi> on ſublunary Bodies; men knowing in ſome meaſure thoſe influences, ſo that they lawfully <hi>Predict according to the known nature and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of thoſe influences; yet will it not thence follow that there is any ſuch thing allowed as <hi>Judiciary Aſtrology,</hi> to predict and foretell what ſhall befall men, and Cities, and Common-wealths, in relation to <hi>humane</hi> affairs, <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary</hi> actings, and <hi>Spontaneous voluntary</hi> tranſactions that depend immediately upon the movings of the <hi>will</hi> of man. All that would naturally follow from thoſe <hi>indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi> premiſes (if granted) would be onely a particular
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:121621:152"/>concluſion, that therefore in ſome things men may be able in a lawfull way probably to predict ſome kinds of events, as that <hi>whether</hi> there ſhall be, or perhaps whether it will be an <hi>healthy</hi> or <hi>ſickly time</hi> for men or beaſts, or ſuch like <hi>naturall</hi> effects of the naturall influences of Stars. Which if men can attain at times of the year to ſee <hi>diſtinctly</hi> in their juſt poſitions, exaltations and conjunctions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and have had experience of the operations of their influences; they may perhaps ſometimes blunder right, that ſo wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, health, or ſickneſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may follow as they conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured. But all this, and if we could name an hundred more <hi>naturall effects,</hi> would not ſatisfie the <hi>Aſtrologer,</hi> or his Clients; nor keep up the reputation of the one, or anſwer the expectation of the other. They ordinarily come to the <hi>Astrologer</hi> with theſe Queries? <q>Such a time I was <hi>born,</hi> after what manner ſhall my <hi>life and death be?</hi> Thither I intend to go, and ſo and ſo to do, what ſhall be the ſucceſſe? Such a night I was robbed, what <hi>manner of perſon</hi> was the Thief, and <hi>where, or how may I find him?</hi>
                     </q> Such a thing I loſt at ſuch a time, how may I <hi>get it again?</hi> I am <hi>loved</hi> and <hi>do love</hi> ſeverall perſons in a way of marriage which may I take as <hi>luckie,</hi> which refuſe as <hi>unluckie?</hi> with infinite the like Queſtions, and many more ſtranger then theſe. To which if the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologer</hi> make no anſwer, the reforters deſpiſe him. If he doth not undertake to give a poſitive anſwer to ſuch inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatories, then I muſt ask him what Scripture, or reaſon doth teach, or <hi>allow</hi> ſuch a kind of <hi>Aſtrology?</hi> The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then <hi>Romane Senate</hi> (without direction from <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 18. whom they knew not, or acknowledged not) made laws againſt <hi>Vaticinatores;</hi> that is, <hi>Thoſe that would foretell things</hi> (<hi>as <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian</hi> in his <hi>ſeventh</hi> Book, <hi>De officio proconſulis,</hi> tells us) And if <hi>Gellius</hi> doth think that the common people underſtood by that name the <hi>Chaldae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans (A. Gell. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Noct. Art.</hi>) this doth not conclude that the learned <hi>Legiſlators</hi> ſo underſtood it. And if they
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:121621:152"/>did, the ſuſpition is yet unremoved, whether all <hi>Astrologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Predictours</hi> of <hi>humane</hi> events and <hi>arbitrary</hi> tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are not of the ſame bran with the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellers? And therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning Aſtrology, condemn all without limitation, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction: ſo that we have no warrant to take <hi>mans</hi> word againſt <hi>Gods</hi> word; but to refuſe their diſtinction of <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> and unlawfull Aſtrology. For all <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> that is properly Aſtrology in the opinion of Aſtrologers (and not <hi>Aſtronomy, Phyſiology or Meteorology &amp;c.</hi>) that is, to predict the effects aforeſaid, is <hi>unlawfull, ſuperſtitious, falſe, abominable, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo are we to underſtand thoſe <hi>Epithites</hi> or aditionall titles of Aſtrology, in divine, and humane pious Writers. For they do no more intimare a lawful <hi>Aſtrology</hi> then in the common expreſſion, <hi>Turpe vitium filthy or uncomely vice</hi> doth intimate that any vice is not filthy but comely. So that Aſtrology was not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore before the time of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> and <hi>An.

<pb n="299" facs="tcp:121621:153"/>of that place in <hi>Job,</hi> chap. 38. v. 31. which our Engliſh Tranſlatours thus render, <hi>Canst thou refrain,</hi> or <hi>bind the ſweet influence of the Pleiades,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:121621:154"/>neither is there virtue and power altogether to be rejected. Influences though they deſcend on man, &amp;c. yet they do not <hi>Compell,</hi> through any neceſſity: For the <hi>free</hi> mind of man is not ſubjected, and as it were, enſlaved to any <hi>Poſition</hi> of the <hi>Starres;</hi> For <hi>Sapiens dominabitur Astris;</hi>
                     </q> that is, <hi>A wiſe man ſhall rule over the Stars.</hi> Thus farre the great Friend of <hi>Astrology,</hi> if not an <hi>Aſtrologer.</hi> In which, I much commend him for his ingenuous and candid dealing. For according to this declaration, there can be no due, true, and lawfull prediction of humane things by the Starres: Though we grant <hi>Meteorologicall effects;</hi> yet this inferrs nothing for rationall events. But our lover of <hi>Aſtrology</hi> afore quoted, allows not in his gloſſe on <hi>Luke</hi> chap. 12. verſ. 54. a certainty of effects of Starres in <hi>Meteorologicals;</hi> How then ſhall we in <hi>Arbitraries?</hi> Nor will the diſtinctions that ſome make, help up the credit of judiciary, or divinatory predicting Aſtrology. <q>They ſay there is a threefold Prognoſtication, or Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; namely, Superſtitious, Supernaturall, natural: And Superſtitious is either Heatheniſh, or Oraculous.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not to ſpend time about the form of theſe diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, either to note the low debaſing, Scriptureleſſe, and unworthy phraſes of Supernaturall Prognoſtication, or Divination, whereby to ſignifie the wonderfull Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the extraordinarily inſpired Prophets; or to ſhew that the terms of the diſtinctions, <hi>Coincidere,</hi> are not diſtinct; Superſtitious, and Supernaturall being both above nature. God ſo acting in the Supernaturall, and Satan in the ſuperſtitious, and Heatheniſh and Oracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous all one; thoſe Oracles they mention of <hi>Apollo</hi> &amp;c. belonging to the Heathen. I ſay not to ſpend time about words; I ſhall briefly ſpeak to the thing; namely, That by the Arguments, the Scriptures uſe and urge againſt Aſtrology in generall, without the leaſt diſtinguiſhing in favour of any kind of Aſtrology, properly ſo called; it
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:121621:154"/>appears that all Aſtrology is Superſtitious, Heatheniſh, &amp;c. To tell us of the effects of <hi>Starres</hi> in Meteors, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Plants, &amp;c. is onely to <hi>Phyſiology,</hi> or <hi>Meteoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.</hi> To diſcourſe further, <q>as to ſay the effect of the Stars is a voluntary action, by which the principall effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient God, is Helped, Aſſiſted, and Furthered, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the effect, as the Maſter Builder is helped by his ſervants to build an Houſe, is not onely an unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, but a moſt ſinfull,</q> I had almoſt ſaid, a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous ſpeech. That God that can do all things immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately of himſelf (as we ſee in the Creation, and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous operations) when he uſeth any of the Creatures in producing any effects, <hi>He Aſſiſteth them,</hi> not <hi>they Him.</hi> And we find not in the Scriptures that he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed any Creatures to predict Voluntary actions, but his Prophers.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that will defend <hi>Aſtrologicall predictions,</hi> by a diſtinction between <hi>Non illicitium,</hi> and <hi>Licitum,</hi> that though Aſtrologicall predictions are not <hi>lawfull;</hi> yet they are not <hi>unlawfull,</hi> do not conſider that <hi>lawfull</hi> and <hi>unlawfull</hi> are immediate contraries; ſo that whatſoever cannot be truly aſſerted to be lawfull, is unlawfull. And as weak is their defence to preſume to ſay that Aſtrologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call predictions are no where in the Word of God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden; either explicitely or implicitely: For not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their ſuperficiall gloſſes (not worth a particular anſwer) on two or three Scriptures that are againſt them, whereby to abate their edge, and to ſave the head of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrology from wounding; it hath been abundantly afore demonſtrated out of many Scriptures, that Aſtrology, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely, without exception is condemned by the Word of God. To whiffle off the dint of any Scripture, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly diſliking Aſtrology (as Iſa. 47.13. &amp;c.) with the diſtinction that their ſuperſtitious, or Heatheniſh A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrology is forbidden, not lawfull Aſtrology; hath been already anſwered: That all Aſtrology, properly ſo called,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:121621:155"/>is condemned in the Word of God, by ſuch and the like <hi>Epithites,</hi> of <hi>ſuperſtitious, heatheniſh, &amp;c.</hi> as all <hi>vice</hi> is condemned by the names of <hi>filthy,</hi> uncomely, (&amp;c.) vice. And thoſe terms added to Aſtrology, of <hi>ſuperſtitious, heatheniſh,</hi> &amp;c. are of the very dint of the Arguments in many places of Scripture, whereby the holy Ghoſt intends to render all Aſtrology odious.</p>
                  <p>For the great matter that ſome would make of the mention of a Starre (<hi>Matth.</hi> 2.2.) appearing at Chriſts birth, &amp;c. whereby to countenance Aſtrology; I ſhall anſwer briefly (becauſe the Preſſe calls upon me to ſhut up.) Either we muſt conſider this Starre <hi>ſingly,</hi> or <hi>conjunctively:</hi> If ſingly, then if this was a reall Starre, it was either ordinary, or extraordinary: If ordinary, namely, made and ſettled in its being in the firſt creation, and ever ſince common in appearance, how ſhould it of its ſelf ſignifie Chriſts birth an effect, once onely to be, from the beginning to the end of the World? It is unpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that a common cauſe, or ſign, of it ſelf can be a ſure demonſtration of a new ſingle ſingular effect, never to be but once. If it was an extraordinary ſtarre, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo it being newly created; which inferrs that God did not create all things in the beginning, no not all kinds of things; for the Starrs, ſay the Philoſophers upon the ground of their different natures, do <hi>Differre ſpecie.</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in kind. If extraordinary onely in appearance, now, and not afore appearing, how ſhould it of it ſelf teach any Aſtrologer the ſaid event, who mainly pretends expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience? If it were a ſeeming ſtarre; that is, a <hi>Comet,</hi> or Blazing ſtar: Firſt, that rather preſageth death, then birth, by reaſon of the noyſome and filthy fumes and exhalations of which it is compounded, and being on fire diffuſeth them into the air in which the Sons of men are enwrapped. Secondly, Then, this ſtarre belongs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Metereologie</hi> (a part of naturall Philoſophy) then to Aſtrology. If we conſider this Starre <hi>conjunctively;</hi>
                     <pb n="303" facs="tcp:121621:155"/>namely, together with propheticall explanations upon it (as the ſtarres in <hi>Joel</hi> 2. And <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.) then the conſideration of this ſtarre was more Theologicall then Aſtrologicall. And this is ſuppoſed by the Learned, both ancient and modern, that the wiſe men of the Eaſt took into conſideration the ſignification of this ſtarre by the help of Scriptures, either immediately coming to their view (being Eaſtern neighbours of the Jews) or medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately by the hands of them that had their gloſſes (of ſuch a thing to come) out of the Scriptures. Tis put upon <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome,</hi> 
                     <q>that he affirms that in the Eaſt in a City called <hi>Seth,</hi> near the Ocean there was a ſociety of men, twelve in number, ſtudients in Aſtrology; who learning out of <hi>Balaams</hi> prophecy, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.17. that ſuch a ſtarre was to appear, gave themſelves from yeare to yeare to obſerve the heavens, and to wait for the appearing of it: and for continuation of that obſervation throughout ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages till it did appear, did at the death of any of the twelve, chooſe another in his room; by which at laſt they ſaw this ſtarre.</q> 
                     <hi>Calcidius</hi> likewiſe a <hi>Platonick</hi> Philoſopher flouriſhing in the time of Chriſts birth, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon <hi>Plato</hi> his <hi>Timeus,</hi> concerning divers Stars and their wonderfull effects, faith thus, There is a more holy and divine hiſtory (meaning the Scriptures) which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports <q>that by the appearing of a certain extraordinary Starre, not diſeaſes and death were foreſhown, but the venerable deſcent of God for mans ſalvation; which Starre was obſerved by the Chaldaeans, who worſhiped God, new born and become man, and offered him gifts.</q> So far <hi>Calcidius.</hi> And whereas in Hebrew, that prophecie of Balaam runnes thus. <hi>There ſhall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Plant</hi> or <hi>Branch</hi> ſhall riſe out of Iſrael (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> Prophecy, <hi>Iſay</hi> 11.1. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.5. and 3.15.) the <hi>Greek</hi> of the Septu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agint (who wrote about 300. years afore Chriſt) tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlates <hi>Star</hi> by <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Theſe Sibylls were ſo well known in the Eaſtern world, that from <hi>them</hi> (how ever they came by it) they might have ſome hints of this Sarr and it's pointing at Chriſt. Theſe things being ſo; 'tis plain, not the Starr of it ſelfe <hi>Aſtrologically,</hi> but the <hi>Theologicall</hi> pre-expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that Starr did cauſe men to underſtand, at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance thereof that Chriſt was to be born. 'Tis well confeſt by ſome, whom they cry up to be for their Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall way, <q>That both Nature and Art may beat a ſtand in ſpirituall things, eſpecially concerning Chriſt, which as the Apoſtle witneſſeth are very myſterious, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.4. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.

Again, if men alone of all the Creatures on Earth, be under the ſtarry power, why do they chuſe days to plant, and days to ſow, and ſo forth; days to tame Cattle, days to put to Males for increaſe of Oxen, or Horſes, and ſuch like?
